"""Grade the acquisition-transfer bound against real device logs.

WHAT IS BEING TESTED, and why it matters more than the number it produces.

`docs/adaptive-playback-spec.md` section 4 admits a candidate rung by comparing a predicted
acquisition time `A_j` against the media duration `D`. Predicting `A_j` for a rung the app has
never visited is the whole difficulty: the plan's first admission rule used the CATALOG rung rate
for it, scored 0.39 coverage against a nominal 0.90, and all fourteen misses were unsafe (finding
R1). The specification then owed an estimator for the two coefficients of

    A = O0 + bytes * tau

and section 8 listed that estimator as the first thing blocking implementation -- "nothing
downstream is implementable without it".

**This tool exists because that estimator is not needed.** Under the model above with the only two
constraints physics supplies -- a fixed cost cannot be negative (`O0 >= 0`) and more bytes cannot
cost less (`tau >= 0`) -- the acquisition time at any other byte count is bounded in closed form by
a SINGLE observation, with no coefficient estimated at all:

    A_j = A_i + (b_j - b_i) * tau
    b_j >= b_i:  tau <= A_i / b_i   (since O0 >= 0)  =>  A_j <= A_i * b_j / b_i
    b_j <  b_i:  tau >= 0                            =>  A_j <= A_i

    both cases:  A_j <= A_i * max(1, b_j / b_i)                          (the TRANSFER BOUND)

Both bounds are TIGHT: the first is attained at `O0 = 0`, the second at `tau = 0`. So the bound is
the exact worst case over every split of `A_i` between the two coefficients that the data cannot
distinguish -- which is precisely the split the corpus was shown to be unable to identify (R7: ten
effective degrees of freedom, `bytes` collinear with rung). The identification problem is dissolved
rather than solved.

Note the asymmetry, because it decides how much of the ladder needs a size prediction at all: a
DOWNSHIFT bound needs no `b_j`. Acquisition cannot rise when the byte count falls, so `A_j <= A_i`
holds whatever the candidate's size turns out to be. Only upshifts need `docs/measurements/
p2h-pms-ladder.md` section 2a's per-rung `sigma`, and the three rungs where `sigma` has no usable
ceiling (320, 720, 2000) are downshift targets.

THREE GRADES, and the first one FAILS on purpose.

1. `pairs`   -- the bound applied to a single observation, over every ordered pair in a case.
                Refuted: ~37% violations. The derivation above is deterministic and real
                acquisitions are not, so a single observation cannot carry an exceedance
                guarantee. Kept as a grade because it is the honest reason the next one exists,
                and because its FAILURE SHAPE is the evidence for the precondition: steady-link
                cases overshoot by 1.05-1.06 (noise around the model) while cases whose link
                changes mid-run overshoot by up to 20x (the "same link regime" precondition
                genuinely broken).
2. `order`    -- the shipped form. Over a trailing window of `n` observations, transfer each to the
                candidate byte count and take the `k`-th largest. The guarantee is an INEQUALITY:

                    P(A_next > kth largest transferred)  <=  k/(n+1)

                NOT an equality, and the difference is not pedantry. The map
                `g_q(b_i, A_i) = A_i * max(1, q/b_i)` is indexed by the QUERY byte count, so it is
                not a fixed function of the bag -- swap the test point with a window member and the
                map itself changes. What carries the exact result is the RAW order statistic (the
                identity map, genuinely fixed); and since every transfer factor is >= 1, the
                transferred bound dominates the raw one pointwise, so the exceedance event is a
                subset and the probability can only be lower. Conservative by construction.
                No coefficient, no fit, no floating point required.

                The `RAW ctrl` column exists because of this -- see `grade_order`.
3. `climb`   -- the question that killed two previous designs. A bound that never admits an
                upshift is useless however safe it is (the specification's own review: "section 5's
                trigger set contains no upshift condition -- climbing unreachable"). Reports, per
                case, the largest byte ratio the bound would still admit, by bisection.

The exchangeability argument covers the STATISTICS. It does not cover the MODEL step: `A_j <=
T_next` holds only if the plant parameters really are those implied by the next observation. That
assumption is named here rather than buried, and grade 1 is what it looks like when it breaks.

And read the right column for it. "Observed exceedance is below nominal" is NOT evidence that
exchangeability holds -- it is forced by the >= 1 inflation and would appear under any degree of
non-exchangeability. The `RAW ctrl` column is the diagnostic; on the p1b corpus it lands at nominal
at all six settings, which does support the assumption, by the route that actually tests it.

Reads the `hls: segment=` lines this project's event log already writes, so it needs no device and
no new instrumentation. Segment 0 is dropped everywhere: it carries decoder and encoder cold start
and is not a steady-state acquisition (`docs/measurements/p1-transaction-anatomy.md`).

    `transfer_on=False` is the CONTROL, and it is the diagnostic this tool was missing. Pinning the
    factor to 1 removes the model entirely and leaves the plain order statistic of past acquisition
    times, which IS a fixed (identity) map on exchangeable variables and therefore does carry the
    exact `k/(n+1)` result. Comparing the two separates two things that the transferred grade alone
    conflates:

    * whether the exchangeability assumption holds on this corpus -- read the CONTROL column, which
      should land at nominal;
    * how much conservatism the transfer buys -- the gap between the columns.

    Without it, "measured exceedance is below nominal" reads as evidence that the assumption holds,
    and it is not: every transfer factor is >= 1, so the transferred bound is pointwise >= the raw
    one and can only miss LOW. That under-shoot appears under any degree of non-exchangeability and
    is therefore not a test of it. Measured here: the raw control lands at nominal at all six
    settings while the transferred grade sits 2-4x under, on an inflation that is > 1 for 44.6% of
    in-window transfers.
