"""Tests for `tools/scrub-logs.py`.

These exist because the scrubber was, for its whole life until 2026-08-27, **inverted relative to
the threat it was written for**. It redacted RFC1918 addresses -- which identify nobody outside the
LAN they are on -- and passed routable ones straight through. A routable address and port identify
a real machine belonging to a real person, and this application reaches other people's servers by
construction: `auth: reached "<handle>" <addr>:<port> (shared)` is logged for every server the
signed-in account can see, so a friend's shared server lands in EVERY captured device log.

Neither existing pass could see it. The declared-secret pass only knows values read out of
`PRIVATE_FILES`, and a shared server's address is in none of them -- it arrives at runtime from
plex.tv. The address pass only matched RFC1918. So 42 occurrences across 21 committed logs survived
a commit whose message was "scrub third-party and device identifiers from the captured logs", and
`tools/scrub-gate.py` -- written in response to that very incident -- inherits `load_secrets` and
cannot catch it either.

The version-string case below is not padding. PMS reports `version=1.43.3.10896-cb3ebc72d`, whose
leading run is four dot-separated numbers, and a public-address regex written without a trailing
guard turns every server version in every log into `<peer-ip-1>`.
