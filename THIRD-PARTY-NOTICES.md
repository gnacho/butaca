# Third-party notices

This file accompanies the **PlxNative** application package (`com.beb.plxnative`), an unofficial
native Plex client for LG webOS 4.x televisions. PlxNative itself is Copyright (c) 2026 Gleb
Linnik and is distributed under the MIT License (see `LICENSE`; the brand reservation and the
non-affiliation statements are in `TRADEMARKS.md`, alongside it in both the repository and this
package).

The file is organised by **relationship**, because relationship — not licence — is what
determines the obligation:

1. **Redistributed in this package** — third-party code or assets that are physically inside the
   files you received (compiled into the `plxnative` binary, embedded in it, or shipped beside
   it). These carry real attribution obligations, discharged here and in `licenses/`.
2. **Dynamically linked, not redistributed** — libraries that already exist on your television
   and are loaded at run time by SONAME. No copy of them is contained in this package.
3. **Not determined** — components we could not establish a licence for, listed as unknown
   rather than guessed.

Full licence texts are **not** repeated inline. They are in the `licenses/` directory of this
package; the exact required contents of that directory are listed in section 5.

## 1. LGPL-2.1 components and your right to modify and replace them

Two different situations, and the difference matters for what we owe you.

### 1.1 FFmpeg — **redistributed inside this package**

PlxNative **ships its own build of FFmpeg**. Earlier releases linked against the television's copy;
they no longer do, because the TV's version moves with the firmware (libavformat 55, 57, 58, 59 and
60 across webOS 2 to 11) and the components compiled into it cannot be determined from outside.

| Shipped file | Upstream | Licence |
|---|---|---|
| `libavutil-plx.so.61`, `libavcodec-plx.so.63`, `libavformat-plx.so.63` | FFmpeg **9.0**, unmodified | LGPL-2.1-or-later |

**These libraries are covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 2.1 or later.** A
complete copy of that licence is supplied with this package at `licenses/LGPL-2.1.txt`.

**Complete corresponding source.** The exact upstream tarball these were built from —
`ffmpeg-9.0.tar.xz`, sha256 `7f607a00dd0d28a729d5a4811205812eef01cf6ef6155025febb6f36a9062d52`,
from <https://ffmpeg.org/releases/> — is attached to every PlxNative release alongside the `.ipk`.
The sources are **unmodified**: no patches are applied. The complete configure invocation that
produced them, including every enabled component, is `ci/build-ffmpeg.sh` in the PlxNative
repository, which is also attached to each release.

**Configuration.** Built with `--disable-everything` plus an explicit component list, **without**
`--enable-gpl`, `--enable-version3` or `--enable-nonfree`, so no GPL-licensed or non-free FFmpeg
component is present. Only demuxers, parsers, bitstream filters and *subtitle* decoders are
enabled — video and audio are decoded by the television's hardware, not by FFmpeg.

**You may modify and replace them.** They are ordinary shared libraries, loaded at run time by
`dlopen` from the application's own directory; no FFmpeg code is linked into the `plxnative`
executable. Build your own from the source above and put it in the app directory under the same
file name, and PlxNative will load yours instead, with no change to the application. The `-plx`
suffix in the file names exists so these cannot be confused with — or accidentally replace — the
television's own FFmpeg; it denotes nothing about their content, which is stock upstream.

One disclosure, so the claim is not overstated: the application reads FFmpeg struct fields at
byte offsets fixed for the ABI of the versions above, and refuses to demux at all if the library
it loads reports different majors. A replacement built from the same upstream release works; one
built from a different release will be declined rather than misread.

### 1.2 Libraries provided by your television

PlxNative also links dynamically against the following **LGPL-2.1-or-later** libraries, which are
part of your television's own system software and are **not** distributed by us:

| Library | Version on this webOS 4.5 build | SONAME(s) the app requests |
|---|---|---|
| GLib | 2.48.2 | `libglib-2.0.so.0` |
| GNU C Library (glibc) | 2.24 | `libc.so.6`, `libm.so.6`, `libpthread.so.0`, `librt.so.1`, `libdl.so.2`, `ld-linux.so.3` |
| libcurl | 7.x | `libcurl.so.4` or `libcurl.so.5` (whichever the firmware provides) |

For these, PlxNative uses the ordinary shared-library mechanism (LGPL-2.1 §6(b)): no code from
them is copied into the executable, and the dynamic loader resolves them at run time against the
television's own `/usr/lib`. To use your own build, install an interface-compatible library under
the same SONAME. The MIT terms under which PlxNative is distributed permit modification of the
application for your own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.

One further disclosure: small fragments of glibc's own startup and compatibility code **are**
statically linked into `plxnative` by the toolchain (`crt1.o` and objects from `libc_nonshared.a`
— this is why the binary defines `_start`, `__libc_csu_init`, `__libc_csu_fini`, `fstat64`,
`lstat64`, `fstatat64`). They are covered by the same LGPL-2.1 notice and licence copy above.
Whether those particular files additionally carry glibc's linking exception was **not verified**
for the NDK build used here.

## 2. Redistributed in this package

### 2.1 Vendored C source, compiled into `plxnative`

**nanosvg** and **nanosvgrast** — Copyright (c) 2013-14 Mikko Mononen <memon@inside.org>
Licence: **Zlib** (`licenses/Zlib.txt`). The vendored headers are byte-identical to upstream
(github.com/memononen/nanosvg); they are not altered.
The upstream headers credit, and we reproduce, the following derivations:

- The SVG parser is based on **Anti-Grain Geometry 2.4** SVG example — Copyright (C) 2002-2004
  Maxim Shemanarev (McSeem).
- Arc calculation code is from **canvg** (https://code.google.com/p/canvg/).
- Bounding-box calculation is based on the method described at blog.hackers-cafe.net.
- The polygon rasterizer is heavily based on the **stb_truetype** rasterizer by Sean Barrett
  (http://nothings.org/).

### 2.2 Icon artwork embedded in `plxnative`

The following SVG icons are compiled into the binary. All are visually modified from upstream
(stroke width and/or colour); modifications are stated where the licence requires it.

**Google Material Design Icons** — the `person` icon (`assets/icons/user.svg`)
Copyright Google LLC. Licence: **Apache License 2.0** (`licenses/Apache-2.0.txt`).
*Modified*: the transparent bounding-box path was removed and an explicit white fill added.
The upstream repository contains no `NOTICE` file, so no NOTICE content is propagated.

**Feather Icons** — the `delete` icon (`assets/icons/backspace.svg`)
Copyright (c) 2013-2023 Cole Bemis. Licence: **MIT** (`licenses/MIT.txt`).
*Modified*: stroke width 2 → 2.2, stroke colour set to white.
The three chevron icons (`chevron.svg`, `chevron-down.svg`, `chevron-up.svg`) use the same vertex
coordinates as Feather's `chevron-right` / `chevron-down` / `chevron-up`, re-expressed as paths
at stroke width 3. Whether that constitutes derivation or independent authorship of trivial
geometry was **not established**; they are credited here out of caution under the same notice.

**Heroicons** — the `check` icon (`assets/icons/check.svg`)
Copyright (c) Tailwind Labs, Inc. Licence: **MIT** (`licenses/MIT.txt`).
The path data `M5 13l4 4L19 7` on a 24×24 grid is identical to Heroicons v1
`optimized/outline/check.svg` (confirmed against upstream). *Modified*: stroke width 2 → 3,
stroke colour set to white.

The remaining icons in the application are original work by the PlxNative author. See section 4
for a trademark note that applies to some of them.

### 2.3 Fonts

**Inter** — `appfont.ttf`, `appfont-bold.ttf`
Copyright 2016 The Inter Project Authors (https://github.com/rsms/inter), per the fonts' own
name table; the licence file shipped with this package states "Copyright 2020". Version
4.001 (git-66647c0bb).
Licence: **SIL Open Font License 1.1** — the full text ships in this package as `OFL.txt`.
*Modified*: these are static instances cut from the Inter variable font at weight 400 / 700 and
optical size 18, with tabular figures frozen and a legacy `kern` table synthesised. Inter's
copyright statement declares **no Reserved Font Name**, so OFL §3 imposes no rename and the
family name "Inter" is retained. The fonts also carry the upstream trademark statement
"Inter UI and Inter is a trademark of rsms."

**Noto Sans CJK KR** — `appfont-cjk.ttf`
Copyright © 2014-2021 Adobe (https://www.adobe.com/), per the font's own name table. Version
2.004, from `github.com/notofonts/noto-cjk` release `Sans2.004`, asset
`Sans/Variable/TTF/NotoSansCJKkr-VF.ttf`.
Licence: **SIL Open Font License 1.1** — the same text that ships in this package as `OFL.txt`.
The licence body distributed with Noto CJK and the one distributed with Inter are identical; only
their copyright headers differ, and both copyright statements are reproduced here and inside each
font's own name table (IDs 0, 7, 13 and 14).
*Modified*: this is a static instance cut from the variable font at weight 400, with the `GSUB`,
`GPOS`, `GDEF`, `BASE`, `DSIG`, `vhea` and `vmtx` tables removed — all of them unreadable by
SDL2_ttf 2.0.x, which performs no shaping and no vertical layout. **No codepoint was removed**:
all 44810 ship. The recipe is `tools/cut-noto-cjk.py`, which pins the input by sha256.
The Reserved Font Name declared by this font's copyright statement is **"Source"** (Noto Sans CJK
derives from Adobe's Source Han Sans), which this package does not use, so OFL §3 imposes no
rename and the family name "Noto Sans CJK KR" is retained. The font also carries the upstream
trademark statement "Source is a trademark of Adobe in the United States and/or other countries."

*Why it ships:* it is the second link of the application's font fallback chain. Inter covers no
Hangul, Kana or Han, so without this face every Korean, Japanese and Chinese title in a Plex
library renders as empty boxes. See `rust-modules/src/text.rs` for the chain and
`rust-modules/src/fontcov.rs` for the coverage each face is required to have.

### 2.4 Rust code statically linked into `plxnative`

The application core is Rust. The Rust standard library is compiled from source
(`-Z build-std`) and linked in, together with the crates below. All of this code is
redistributed in the binary. Where a package offers a choice of licences, our election is
stated; election does not alter your rights under the other arms.

**Elected MIT** (`licenses/MIT.txt`), with the copyright holders required by that licence:

| Package | Version(s) | Declared licence | Copyright |
|---|---|---|---|
| The Rust standard library (`core`, `alloc`, `std`, `panic_unwind`, `unwind`, and the `rustc-std-workspace-*` shims) | rustc 1.98.0-nightly (c397dae80 2026-07-02) | MIT OR Apache-2.0 | The Rust Project Developers |

**MIT only — no alternative arm** (`licenses/MIT.txt`):

| Package | Version | Copyright |
|---|---|---|
| simd-adler32 | 0.3.9 | (c) 2021 Marvin Countryman |
| zmij | 1.0.21 | David Tolnay (a Rust port of Victor Zverovich's C++ `zmij`) |
| rust-lang/libm — compiled *inside* `compiler_builtins` and exposed as intrinsics on this target | as vendored in rustc 1.98.0-nightly | (c) 2018 Jorge Aparicio; musl libc (c) 2005-2020 Rich Felker, et al.; CORE-MATH; and the fdlibm-derived notice: (c) 1993, 2004 Sun Microsystems; (c) 2003-2011 David Schultz; (c) 2003-2009 Steven G. Kargl; (c) 2003-2009 Bruce D. Evans; (c) 2008 Stephen L. Moshier; (c) 2017-2018 Arm Limited |

**Elected Apache-2.0** (`licenses/Apache-2.0.txt`) — these two offer no MIT arm:

| Package | Version | Declared licence | Copyright |
|---|---|---|---|
| moxcms | 0.8.1 | BSD-3-Clause OR Apache-2.0 | (c) Radzivon Bartoshyk |
| pxfm | 0.1.29 | BSD-3-Clause OR Apache-2.0 | (c) Radzivon Bartoshyk |

**Conjunctive licence — no election possible:**

**compiler_builtins 0.1.160**, declared `MIT AND Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception AND (MIT OR
Apache-2.0)`. Both `licenses/MIT.txt` and `licenses/Apache-2.0.txt` together with
`licenses/LLVM-exception.txt` apply. It contains code derived from **LLVM's compiler-rt**
(https://llvm.org/): work derived from compiler-rt prior to 2019-01-19 is used under the MIT
licence with the copyright "Copyright (c) 2009-2016 by the contributors listed in CREDITS.TXT"
(https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/compiler-rt/CREDITS.TXT); work derived after
that date is used under Apache-2.0 with the LLVM exception. The LLVM exception waives Apache-2.0
§4(a), (b) and (d) for portions embedded into object form by compilation; it waives nothing in
MIT, so the MIT notice above is required and is given.

**Unicode Character Database tables in Rust `core`**
(`library/core/src/unicode`, statically linked; reached by character classification and case
mapping): Copyright © 1991-2024 Unicode, Inc. Licence: **UNICODE LICENSE V3**
(`licenses/Unicode-3.0.txt`). That licence permits this notice to appear in associated
documentation, which is what this file is.

**Independent JPEG Group acknowledgement.** The `image` crate contains a Rust translation of
`jfdctint.c` from the Independent JPEG Group's libjpeg version 9a
(`src/codecs/jpeg/transform.rs`), reached through the JPEG encoder used by the application's
capture module, which is compiled into every configuration of the binary. As required by IJG
condition (2) for distribution of executable code:

> This software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group.

IJG code is copyright (C) 1991-2014, Thomas G. Lane, Guido Vollbeding.

**Not in the binary, listed to prevent a false conclusion.** `serde_derive`, `proc-macro2`,
`quote`, `syn`, `unicode-ident` and `autocfg` are host build-time machinery and contribute no
code to the shipped binary. `foldhash` appears in the Rust source tree but is **not** compiled
here (the standard library takes `hashbrown` with default features disabled, which does not
enable it) — verified absent from the binary. `rustc-literal-escaper`, `proc_macro`,
`panic_abort` and `std_detect` are compiled by `-Z build-std` but leave no code in this binary.

### 2.5 Compiler runtime fragments statically linked into `plxnative`

- **GCC runtime startup objects** (`crtbegin.o`, `crtend.o`) from the webOS NDK's GCC 12.2.0.
  Licence: GPL-3.0-or-later **WITH GCC-exception-3.1**. The GCC Runtime Library Exception
  permits distributing the result of compilation under our own terms, and the compilation used
  only Eligible Compilation Processes; no additional licence text is required or supplied.
- **`libglibc_polyfills.a`** from the webosbrew native-toolchain NDK (supplies `getauxval` and
  its initialiser). **Licence not determined** — see section 3.

### 2.6 Native crash capture

This fork removed Sentry Native and its `sentry-crash` handler with the telemetry system; the
local crash log is written by the app's own async-signal-safe tracer (`src/crashtrace.c`).

---

## 3. Dynamically linked, not redistributed

The libraries below are part of your television's software. This package contains no copy of
them; PlxNative loads them at run time. Where a licence would require reproducing a notice in
copies, no copy is being distributed, so nothing is owed — the credits are given because they
are due in substance.

| Library | Version on this build | Licence | Note |

---

## 4. Not determined, and matters outside licensing

**Licence not established.** The following are used but we could not determine a licence, and we
decline to guess one:

- `libGLESv2.so.2` — the television's OpenGL ES 2.0 implementation (an LG shim over the ARM Mali
  driver). Proprietary; no published licence located.
- `libAcbAPI.so.1`, `libplayerAPIs.so.1` (StarfishMediaAPIs), `libpf-1.0.so.1` — LG proprietary
  media components of webOS. No published licence located. PlxNative calls their published ABI;
  nothing of LG's is copied into or distributed with this package.
- `libglibc_polyfills.a` from the webosbrew native-toolchain NDK, statically linked (see 2.5).
  No licence statement was found in the NDK tree or in the archive itself.

**Non-affiliation.** PlxNative is an independent, unofficial application. It is not affiliated
with, endorsed by, or sponsored by LG Electronics, Plex GmbH, Fandango Media (Rotten Tomatoes),
IMDb.com, or The Movie Database. "webOS", "LG", "Plex", "Rotten Tomatoes", "IMDb", "TMDB" and all
other trademarks are the property of their respective owners. Where those names appear in the
application, they identify whose review score is being shown and nothing more.

**Third-party brands in the interface (not a licence matter).** Review scores fetched from the
user's own Plex Media Server are labelled with the name of the service that published them, set
as ordinary text. No third-party logo, wordmark or brand colour is reproduced: the only glyphs
beside a score are two original drawings — a tomato and a group of people — that indicate the
verdict, not the vendor. Nothing here is owed under any licence in this file.

*This paragraph previously described a set of shipped icons depicting the Rotten Tomatoes fruit
and popcorn marks, and IMDb/TMDB rendered as name-and-brand-colour chips. Those eleven assets were
removed in favour of the above; the notice is kept accurate rather than deleted, because a stale
disclosure that over-states what a package contains is its own problem.*

---

## 5. The `licenses/` directory

This package must contain exactly the following licence texts, verbatim:

| File | Required by |
|---|---|
| `licenses/LGPL-2.1.txt` | FFmpeg, GLib, GNU C Library (§1) — GNU Lesser General Public License, version 2.1 |
| `licenses/MIT.txt` | Feather Icons, Heroicons and the MIT-elected Rust packages (§2.2, §2.4). One copy of the MIT text; the copyright holders it refers to are the ones named in this file |
| `licenses/Apache-2.0.txt` | Google Material Design Icons; moxcms; pxfm; compiler_builtins (§2.2, §2.4) |
| `licenses/LLVM-exception.txt` | compiler_builtins (§2.4) |
| `licenses/Unicode-3.0.txt` | Unicode Character Database tables in Rust `core` (§2.4) — UNICODE LICENSE V3, "Copyright © 1991-2024 Unicode, Inc." |
| `licenses/Zlib.txt` | nanosvg (§2.1) |

`OFL.txt` (SIL Open Font License 1.1, for **Inter and Noto Sans CJK KR** — §2.3) already ships at
the root of this package. Keep it there; do not add a second copy under `licenses/`, and do not
add a second copy for the second font: the two upstream licence bodies are byte-identical, and
what differs between them (the copyright statement and the Reserved Font Name) is reproduced in
§2.3 and carried inside each font's own name table.

No BSD-3-Clause text is required because Apache-2.0 is elected for `moxcms` and `pxfm`. No
GPL-3.0 text is required: the only GPL-3-covered components are GCC runtime pieces carried by
the Runtime Library Exception and the television's own `libgcc_s`.

---

## 6. Deliberately not listed

Two third-party components exist in the PlxNative source repository but are **not** part of this
package, and therefore carry no obligation discharged here: **libjpeg-turbo**
(`libturbojpeg.so.0`, copied to developer televisions by the development deploy step only) and
**jsmpeg** (a host-side development tool). Neither is present in the installed application.
