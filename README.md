# PlxNative

A fast, unofficial [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/) client for LG webOS televisions. Native, not a web
page — the interface is drawn straight on the GPU at 60 fps, and video plays on the TV's own decoder.

*In daily use on a 2019 LG set. Get it from the
[latest release](https://github.com/GLinnik21/plx-native/releases/latest).*

## Why this exists

The official Plex app on my old LG is slow. Scrolling a shelf stutters, opening a poster takes a
beat too long. It behaves like a web page because it is one: a web app running in the television's
Chromium. Patching it doesn't help — the ceiling isn't the code, it's the browser.

So I threw the browser away.

PlxNative draws straight on the GPU and hands video to the same silicon the built-in apps use. No
Chromium, no JavaScript, no web view. It just draws. Almost all of it is Rust, and I use it every
day to watch things off my server in the next room.

## What it looks like

Real screenshots off the television, not mockups.

![Home](docs/screenshots/home.jpg)

**Home** — a rotating hero from what you're partway through and what's just landed, shelves under it.

![Library](docs/screenshots/library.jpg)

**Library** — sort, filter (including unwatched-only), and an A–Z rail down the side.

![Search](docs/screenshots/search.jpg)

**Search** — one query across every server you can reach, results grouped by kind.

![Player](docs/screenshots/player.jpg)

**Player** — the transport with chapters and track menus, drawn on top of video the
television is decoding itself.

## What it does

- **An interface that keeps up with the remote.** 60 fps on the 2019 set I develop on, with
  frame-rate regression scenes that measure it on the television rather than trusting it.
- **Sign in on the TV** with an on-screen QR code and pick a Plex Home profile.
- **Browse and search your libraries** — on your own servers and on ones shared with you. Your
  servers' libraries, that is, not Plex's catalogue or Watchlist.
- **Direct play** H.264 and HEVC — 4K, 10-bit, Dolby Vision profiles 5 and 8, E-AC-3 Atmos —
  decided against your television's own codec table where it publishes one. Anything else the
  server transcodes, and you can switch a playback to Auto to follow a link whose speed changes.
- **Everything you expect while watching**: resume, seek and scrub, chapters, audio and subtitle
  tracks (including image subtitles), Skip Intro, Skip Credits, Up Next with auto-advance, and
  progress reported back to your server.

## Will it work on my television?

Video has been watched on two sets in the world, so this is deliberately specific about which:

| Your set | What's known |
|---|---|
| **webOS 4.5** — LG 49SM9000PLA | Plays video. My own television; tested before every release. |
| **webOS 6.5.2** — one LG 65UP7560AUD | Plays video, [reported by someone else](https://github.com/GLinnik21/plx-native/issues/22) — six of eight attempts. |
| **webOS 10.3.1** — one rented set | The pipeline accepted HEVC direct play, though nobody watched the picture. Every server transcode is refused, so a file this app can't direct-play won't play at all. |
| **Anything else from webOS 4.0 up** | Starts — the binary resolves cleanly against nine real firmware images. Nothing further is known. |
| **webOS 3.9 and older** | Won't start — you'd get a tile that does nothing. |

If your set is in the middle, [tell me what happened](https://github.com/GLinnik21/plx-native/issues)
— it working is as useful a report as it failing.

## Installing

You need a Plex account and server, and a way to install unsigned apps: the
[Homebrew Channel](https://github.com/webosbrew/webos-homebrew-channel) or LG Developer Mode. You do
**not** normally need a rooted TV — the app runs in LG's normal sandbox. Some Realtek sets
need a [sandbox repair for native video](docs/native-video-sandbox.md). The in-app repair
requires rooted Homebrew Channel access. An experimental
[non-root Developer Mode guide](docs/non-root-video-sandbox.md) covers LG’s signed configuration option.

Grab the `.ipk` from the [latest release](https://github.com/GLinnik21/plx-native/releases) and
install it with the Homebrew Channel or
[dev-manager-desktop](https://github.com/webosbrew/dev-manager-desktop).

> **Not in the Homebrew Channel's app list yet** — the submission is
> [open](https://github.com/webosbrew/apps-repo/pull/224). Until it lands, point the Channel at the
> `.ipk` yourself.

**Check the download against `ipk.sha256` before you sideload it.** Nothing in this chain is
code-signed, and pointing the Channel at a bare `.ipk` skips the hash check it would otherwise do
for you. [docs/install-and-verify.md](docs/install-and-verify.md) has the commands, which release
asset is which, and what the app writes, reads and reaches once it's on your set.

Installing through **Developer Mode** also means LG expires the session after 1000 hours and
*uninstalls your apps* when it does; dev-manager-desktop can renew it. The Homebrew Channel has no
expiry.

## Privacy

**Your library data never reaches me.** The app talks to your Plex server, to `plex.tv` to sign in,
and to `discover.provider.plex.tv` for cast biographies.

**Crash reports and usage analytics are off until you turn them on** — two separate first-run
questions, each answerable with Don't Share, both reversible later under Account → Settings →
Privacy & data. No title, search term, subtitle line, server name or address can appear in any
report. [`PRIVACY.md`](PRIVACY.md) is the whole statement, including the schemas.

## The honest scope

I built this for how *I* watch, so it's narrower than Plex's:

- **Movies and TV shows.** No music, no photos, no live TV or DVR.
- **No typing in server addresses.** Servers come from your Plex account; set them up on a phone or
  PC and choose from what's there. Servers reached through Plex's relay, or that require an
  encrypted connection, are supported but haven't been watched end to end.
- **One person's spare time.** There will be bugs I haven't hit, because I don't watch the way you do.

If that fits, it's genuinely nice to use. If it doesn't, the official app will serve you better.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome, especially from anyone whose television or library differs
from mine — [**docs/building.md**](docs/building.md) is the build and the test loop, and says what
hardware I most need help with. Security issues go through [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) rather than
a public issue.
