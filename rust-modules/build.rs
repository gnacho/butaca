//! Install identity generation, the version string every build reports, and link configuration for everything cargo
//! itself LINKS on the developer's own machine — the host UI simulator, and the host TEST BINARY.
//!
//! Identity and version generation run for EVERY build. Host link configuration is a **no-op for the build
//! that ships**: the television binary is linked by the Makefile, not by cargo (the crate is a
//! staticlib; a staticlib has no link step), so the ARM cross build reaches the early return below
//! and emits nothing further.
//!
//! **The gate is the TARGET, not the `hostsim` feature, and that distinction was paid for.** It
//! used to be the feature, on the reasoning that the simulator is "the only configuration that
//! links anything here" — which was true only for as long as no host test reached the drawing
//! layer. `cargo test --lib` builds an executable too, and macOS `ld64` dead-strips BEFORE it
//! reports undefined symbols, so a test binary that never made `gfx`/`text`/`svg` reachable linked
//! happily against nothing but libSystem. Restructure phase 5b ended that: `app/bridge.rs`'s tests
//! stand up the REAL rig — `Bridge` holds a `text::TtfMeasure`, and a real `Dispatcher` mounts real
//! screens whose `draw` bodies call `gfx` — so those atoms are live, their `extern "C"` GL/SDL_ttf
//! /nanosvg references become hard undefined symbols, and the default `make check` pass stopped
//! linking. Gating on the target instead means any host build that cargo links gets what it needs,
//! whether or not somebody remembered a feature flag; CI already installs `libsdl2-dev`,
//! `libsdl2-ttf-dev` and `libgl1-mesa-dev` before `make check` for exactly this reason.
//!
//! Why a build script rather than `.cargo/config.toml`, which is where this crate's other
//! target-bound flags live: the library search path is not a constant. Homebrew is at
//! `/opt/homebrew` on Apple Silicon and `/usr/local` on Intel, while Linux distributions publish
//! their SDL locations through pkg-config. A hardcoded guess fails as an "SDL2 not found" link
//! error a long way from its cause.

/// Publish `PLX_VERSION` — the version this build REPORTS, which is not always the version it was
/// cut from.
///
/// `Cargo.toml`, `pkg/appinfo.json` and `ipkroot/ctl/control` all carry the same three integers,
/// and `ci/check-package.py` fails the build if they ever disagree: LG accepts nothing else in a
/// package, so the published number has to stay exactly `X.Y.Z`. But a release commit leaves the
/// tree AT the version it just published, so every developer build after it reported that number
/// as its own — to `X-Plex-Version` on the account's authorized-devices list, to Sentry as the
/// release `plxnative@X.Y.Z`, to PostHog as `app_version`, and on the diagnostics panel that is
/// meant to be photographed into a bug report. A crash from somebody's working tree landed on the
/// shipped release's tally and nothing downstream could separate the two.
///
/// So a build that is not a release names the version it is working TOWARDS and says what it is:
/// `0.5.0` published, `0.6.0-dev` in the tree.
///
/// **It is the next MINOR, because this project is trunk-based.** Trunk is where features land, so
/// the next thing cut from it is a minor (or a major, when the maintainer decides that); a PATCH is
/// only ever cut from an existing minor's own line, where trunk's number is not the question being
/// asked. Naming the next patch would therefore be wrong in the common case and right in none —
/// `0.5.1-dev` on trunk claims to be heading for a release that, by policy, is not cut from trunk
/// at all. It also makes the semver ordering mean something: `0.6.0-dev` precedes `0.6.0`, so the
/// tree really is a pre-release of what it is heading for, rather than of a version nobody plans.
///
/// A MAJOR is not guessed at, and cannot be: nothing in this file can see that decision, and
/// `1.0.0-dev` claimed on every ordinary build would be a false promise rather than a cautious one.
/// The invariant that actually matters is weaker and is preserved either way — the reported version
/// must never be a number a release has already used.
///
/// **A maintenance line signals itself with a tracked marker file, `RELEASE_LINE`** (repo root,
/// sibling of this crate — `../RELEASE_LINE` from `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR`), rather than a git branch
/// lookup: a build script that reads git state is wrong in a tarball, in CI's detached-HEAD
/// checkout, and in a worktree whose branch name says nothing about the line it was cut for. The
/// file is absent on trunk, so trunk's behavior above is unchanged when it is missing. Present, it
/// names the line's `X.Y` (e.g. `0.6`), and a dev build on that line reports the next PATCH rather
/// than the next minor — `0.6.1-dev` after `0.6.0` — because on a maintenance line trunk's
/// "next minor" question does not apply at all.
///
/// **The suffix reaches the reported string ONLY.** It never enters `pkg/appinfo.json` or the
/// control file: `1.0.0-rc1` is not installable on a webOS television, which is also why
/// `ci/bump-version.py` refuses to write anything but three integers. `ci/check-package.py`
/// gates the other direction — a package built for the stable id may not carry a `-dev` binary.
///
/// **`PLX_CHANNEL=nightly` adds a third arm**, on top of `PLX_RELEASE`: a nightly build is always
/// a `RELEASE=1` build (no dev triggers ever ship under that id — see the Makefile's
/// `release-guard`), but it must not claim to BE the release its own `Cargo.toml` names, the same
/// reason a plain dev build cannot. So it reports the same "next minor, or next patch on a
/// maintenance line" number the `-dev` suffix would, dated instead of merely suffixed:
/// `0.7.0-nightly-20260919` rather than `0.7.0-dev`. The date comes from `PLX_NIGHTLY_DATE`
/// (`YYYYMMDD`, validated by [`is_nightly_date`]) because a bare channel name cannot tell two
/// nightly cuts of the same commit-less trunk apart — X-Plex-Version, the Sentry release and the
/// diagnostics panel all need that to distinguish "today's nightly" from "yesterday's" the way
/// `PLX_BUILD_SHA` cannot (trunk moves several times a day; the reported version is what a bug
/// report actually names).
///
/// The input is `PLX_RELEASE` and (new) `PLX_CHANNEL`/`PLX_NIGHTLY_DATE`, exported by the Makefile
/// for `RELEASE=1` and `FLAVOR=nightly` respectively and by nothing else, so the developer answer
/// is what an ordinary `make`, `make check`, `make sim` or a bare `cargo build` produces —
/// `PLX_CHANNEL` unset (or empty) leaves every existing build byte-for-byte as it always reported.
