//! that matters**: the television binary is linked by the Makefile, not by cargo (the crate is a
//! staticlib; a staticlib has no link step), so the ARM build reaches the early return below and
//! emits nothing further. Only `--features hostsim`, which builds an actual executable, gets past
//! it.
//!
//! Why a build script rather than `.cargo/config.toml`, which is where this crate's other
//! target-bound flags live: the library search path is not a constant. Homebrew is at
//! `/opt/homebrew` on Apple Silicon and `/usr/local` on Intel, and a hardcoded guess fails as an
//! "SDL2 not found" link error a long way from its cause. Asking `brew` is the only answer that is
//! right on both.

/// Publish `PLX_VERSION` — the version this build REPORTS, which is not always the version it was
/// cut from.
///
/// `Cargo.toml`, `pkg/appinfo.json` and `ipkroot/ctl/control` all carry the same three integers,
/// and `ci/check-package.py` fails the build if they ever disagree: LG accepts nothing else in a
/// package, so the published number has to stay exactly `X.Y.Z`. But a release commit leaves the
/// tree AT the version it just published, so every developer build after it reported that number
/// as its own — to `X-Plex-Version` on the account's authorized-devices list, to Sentry as the
/// release `plxnative@X.Y.Z`, to PostHog as `app_version`, and on the diagnostics panel that is
/// meant to be photographed into a bug report. A crash from somebody's working tree landed on the
/// shipped release's tally and nothing downstream could separate the two.
///
/// So a build that is not a release names the version it is working TOWARDS and says what it is:
/// `0.5.0` published, `0.6.0-dev` in the tree.
///
/// **It is the next MINOR, because this project is trunk-based.** Trunk is where features land, so
/// the next thing cut from it is a minor (or a major, when the maintainer decides that); a PATCH is
/// only ever cut from an existing minor's own line, where trunk's number is not the question being
/// asked. Naming the next patch would therefore be wrong in the common case and right in none —
/// `0.5.1-dev` on trunk claims to be heading for a release that, by policy, is not cut from trunk
/// at all. It also makes the semver ordering mean something: `0.6.0-dev` precedes `0.6.0`, so the
/// tree really is a pre-release of what it is heading for, rather than of a version nobody plans.
///
/// A MAJOR is not guessed at, and cannot be: nothing in this file can see that decision, and
/// `1.0.0-dev` claimed on every ordinary build would be a false promise rather than a cautious one.
/// The invariant that actually matters is weaker and is preserved either way — the reported version
/// must never be a number a release has already used.
///
/// **A maintenance line signals itself with a tracked marker file, `RELEASE_LINE`** (repo root,
/// sibling of this crate — `../RELEASE_LINE` from `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR`), rather than a git branch
/// lookup: a build script that reads git state is wrong in a tarball, in CI's detached-HEAD
/// checkout, and in a worktree whose branch name says nothing about the line it was cut for. The
/// file is absent on trunk, so trunk's behavior above is unchanged when it is missing. Present, it
/// names the line's `X.Y` (e.g. `0.6`), and a dev build on that line reports the next PATCH rather
/// than the next minor — `0.6.1-dev` after `0.6.0` — because on a maintenance line trunk's
/// "next minor" question does not apply at all.
///
/// **The suffix reaches the reported string ONLY.** It never enters `pkg/appinfo.json` or the
/// control file: `1.0.0-rc1` is not installable on a webOS television, which is also why
/// `ci/bump-version.py` refuses to write anything but three integers. `ci/check-package.py`
/// gates the other direction — a package built for the stable id may not carry a `-dev` binary.
///
/// The input is `PLX_RELEASE`, exported by the Makefile for `RELEASE=1` and by nothing else, so
/// the developer answer is what an ordinary `make`, `make check`, `make sim` or a bare `cargo
/// build` produces. `rerun-if-env-changed` makes cargo re-run this when that flips; the emitted
/// value is itself tracked, so the crate rebuilds with it.
