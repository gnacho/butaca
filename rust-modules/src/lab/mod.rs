//! **Lab Diagnostics** — the app pushing its own log off a television nobody here can reach.
//!
//! LG Cloud Test Lab rents physical sets on webOS/SoC combinations we do not own. It gives a
//! picture and a virtual remote, and **no console, no ssh, no stdout and no way to download a
//! file**. So a bug can be reproduced on a k8hpp webOS 10 set, watched happening, and the agent
//! fixing it cannot see one line of `plxnative-events.log`. Every other diagnostic surface in this
//! repository assumes ssh (`crate::dev`'s ~44 `/tmp` triggers, the remote FIFO, the capture
//! listener, `make -s print-eventlog`) and is therefore unreachable there.
//!
//! This module is the bridge: a **bounded ring of the log lines the app already writes**, plus the
//! structured state `crate::player::Diag` already carries, uploaded over pinned TLS to a receiver
//! on the developer's Mac (`tools/plxnative-lab`), triggered by a remote button, a menu row or the
//! optional authenticated command channel. `docs/lab-diagnostics.md` is the design note; read it
//! before extending any of this.
//!
//! # Three rules, all structural rather than a matter of care
//!
//! 1. **It is not in any build a user can install.** The whole module is behind the
//!    `lab-diagnostics` cargo feature, which — unlike `devtools`/`devtriggers` — is **not in the
//!    default set at all**, so a release build cannot acquire it by forgetting a flag. Without the
//!    feature every entry point below is a compile-time no-op: no ring, no allocation, no key arm,
//!    no config read, no socket, no thread.
//! 2. **Call sites carry no `#[cfg]`.** `lib.rs`'s log tap, `app.rs`'s key ladder,
//!    `ui::consts::is_bound` and the two menus all call plain functions that fold away. That is
//!    `crate::dev`'s shape and it is deliberate: hand-written `#[cfg]` PAIRS at call sites are the
//!    one hazard `.claude/hooks/release-config-check.py` exists for, and the gating lives in ONE
//!    file instead of eight.
//! 3. **Nothing enters the payload that is not already allowed on a photograph.** The envelope is
//!    built from `Diag`, `webos::Info` and `devcaps::Caps` — numbers, bools, enums and short
//!    platform strings — under the same no-URL / no-credential / no-identity rule `ui::stats`
//!    states at length, and every ring record passes [`snapshot::scrub`] on the way out on top of
//!    the `redact_tokens` it already passed on the way in. See [`snapshot`].
//!
//! # What it deliberately is not
//!
//! Not analytics, not a crash service and not general device administration. Lab Control can ask
//! this app to replay only its bounded synthetic-input/test token grammar; it cannot invoke a
//! shell, read a file, call an arbitrary URL or control webOS outside this SDL process. Both
//! directions are initiated by the television as pinned, authenticated HTTPS POSTs.
