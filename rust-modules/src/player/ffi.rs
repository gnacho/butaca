//! player::ffi — the starfish.c seam (sf_* / acb_* verbs). These stay C (the mangled-C++ + ACB
//! ABI). The library thread calls back into our sf_on_event / acb_on_event (defined in mod.rs).
//! Signatures mirror `src/starfish.h` exactly; `long` is 32-bit on the arm target -> c_long.
//!
//! **Everything here but `sf_load` takes a [`MainThread`]**, because the seam has no locking of
//! its own: the ACB bind order is a bare call sequence, and `sf_feed` races the pump's own
//! bookkeeping. The raw declarations live in a private `sys` module so the token is the only way
//! to reach them — a `use super::ffi::sys` from elsewhere in `player/` does not compile, which is
//! what makes this a guarantee rather than a note.
//!
//! The wrappers stay `unsafe fn`, one-for-one with the declarations. Several take raw pointers,
//! and the pointer-free ones still carry ordering preconditions the C side does not check
//! (`acb_start` before the bind completes, `sf_play` after `sf_destroy`). Calling any of them
//! remains something to think about; the token only says *where* from.
