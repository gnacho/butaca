//! player — the buffer-feed video engine (was src/playback.c). THREADING: everything
//! here except sf_on_event/acb_on_event runs on the SDL main thread. Those two are
//! #[no_mangle] and run on the StarfishMediaAPIs library thread; they touch ONLY
//! `SHARED`. Player-engine callback/transport state is synchronized in `shared.rs`; route
//! ownership and route-changing intents have their separate synchronized authority in

//! which `plex_run` mints once and passes down; it is `!Send`, so a closure that captured one
//! cannot be handed to `task::spawn`. The exceptions are the honest ones: the two callbacks
//! above are `extern "C"` entry points *from* the library thread and touch only `SHARED`, and
//! `threads::load_thread` calls `sf_load` off-main by design (see `ffi`).

// Cleared to false if the pipeline can't be reached (sf_send_segment == 0), which drops seeks
// back to the robust reload-per-seek path.
//
// SCOPE: this is a **per-session probe, not a device-capability latch**, and
// `engine::start_bufferfeed` re-arms it to true for every new session. What `sf_send_segment`
// reports is whether `sf_pipeline()` could reach the CustomPipeline behind the CURRENT
// StarfishMediaAPIs object: `SMP_READY()` (dispatch admission set after construction, and cleared
// by destruction or quarantine) plus two non-null shared_ptr hops, `object+0x4c` -> `player+0x04`
// (src/starfish.c). A cleared ready bit does not prove that object storage is unconstructed: the
// safety path retains a quarantined object forever. Every one of these tests is a property of the
// current dispatchable object, not a device capability. `sendSegmentEvent` itself returns
// void, so a 0 here NEVER means "the segment event was rejected", only "there was nothing to
// call it on" — a liveness/timing condition by construction.
// Latching it for the process was therefore a bug with a very long tail: one teardown-window
// race downgraded every later seek of every later item to a ~1 s reload until the app was
// restarted. Re-arming per session is self-healing rather than oscillating, too: the fallback
// the clear selects (`reload_at`) builds a fresh Starfish object, so the exact condition that
// produced the 0 cannot survive into the session that re-arms — and if a fresh session really
// can't reach its pipeline either, it re-clears after one seek and stays on the reload path.
// It remains a static rather than an `Engine` field only because `pump.rs` reads it without an
// Engine borrow at hand; its LIFETIME is the Engine's, since `start_bufferfeed` is the sole

/// The (no-video, not-transcoding) arm — an audio-only DIRECT-PLAYED file — is worded for the
