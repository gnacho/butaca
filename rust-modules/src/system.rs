//
// `docs/perf-damage-tracking-verdict.md` §5 is the design. The whole app has run with
// `set_opaque_region(NULL)` since boot — on Home, Library, Detail, Person, Login and Profiles,
// where there is no video plane underneath and nothing to show through. The protocol calls the
// opaque region "an optimization hint for the compositor that lets it optimize the redrawing of
// content behind opaque regions", and a sibling measured LG's `surface-manager` at 34.4% of every
// frame's GPU cycles, doing exactly one full-screen textured blit of our surface. Whether that
// charge is per-COMMIT bookkeeping or per-BLENDED-PIXEL is the question, and nobody has varied the
// variable: all four prior compositor measurements held the surface non-opaque at 1920x1080.
//
// **Default behaviour is byte-identical.** Without the trigger `region_init` never runs, `ENABLED`
// stays false, and `opaque_route` returns on its first load.
//
// **Route-scoped, and it must be.** Marking the surface opaque while the hardware video plane is
// slaved beneath it would occlude a plane that has not torn down yet — which is why the player
// route re-asserts NULL every frame today. `opaque_route(player)` therefore asserts NULL on the
// player route and the full region everywhere else, and remembers which it last sent so an
// unchanged route costs one atomic load and no protocol traffic (the region is double-buffered
// but otherwise STICKY: "the pending and current regions are never changed" otherwise).
//
// **No new link dependency, deliberately.** A `wl_region` needs `wl_compositor.create_region`, and
// the only wayland objects this app has are the display and surface SDL handed it — so the
// compositor has to come from a registry bind. `wl_proxy_marshal_constructor_versioned` is absent
// from `libwayland-client` on webOS below 4.4.2 and the `*_interface` data symbols would be three
// more `DT_NEEDED` requirements, so every one of them is resolved through `RTLD_DEFAULT` against
// the libwayland-client already linked and loaded. `tools/fwcompat.py` is unchanged by this file.
