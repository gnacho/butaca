// Search's body IS `search::key`; see the note at its guard).

// part of the behaviour: an earlier guard subsumes later ones it overlaps with — `key_player_failed`
// does, on purpose — and that is only legible while the tests sit in one list, in order, in one
// place.
//

// fingerprint each press produces against a recorded table.
