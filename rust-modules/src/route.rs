/// before it is a parameter.
///
/// # Why this is not a bitrate field on [`crate::plex::TranscodeSpec`]
///
/// That is the shape this began as, and it does nothing for the one file it exists for.
/// [`build_stream`] picks direct play → remux → re-encode BEFORE any spec is built, and only the
/// re-encode branch's query has ever carried `maxVideoBitrate`: direct play streams the file's own
/// bytes with no encoder anywhere to read a cap, and a remux copies the codecs and deliberately
/// sends no cap at all (a cap is exactly what would force the re-encode it exists to avoid). So a
/// 30 Mbit/s source on a 4 Mbit/s link — the case the whole feature is about — direct-plays
/// straight past a number set on the spec, and the user who picked "4 Mbps" sees no change
/// whatsoever. `plex::params`' own doc argued this out for a LINK ceiling long before there was a
/// user-chosen one, and the argument transfers unchanged.
///
/// So a rung is spent the way [`crate::plex::link_policy`] spends the relay tier: **deny the two
/// flavors that ship the file at its own rate, leaving the one flavor whose whole point is that
/// the server picks the rate** ([`quality_policy`]). Only then does the rung's number reach the
/// wire, as [`crate::plex::Ceiling`] on the re-encode query.
///
/// # The ladder, and why these rungs
///
/// A standard descending ladder, each rung pairing a rate with the frame that rate can actually
/// carry — a rung that halves the rate and keeps 4K asks the server for something it cannot make
/// look like anything.
///
/// **A rung is a CONTENT rate; the checklist's legs are LINK rates, and the two are not the same
/// number.** LG's #43 CASE1 exercises 512 Kbps / 1 Mbps / 7 Mbps / 17.5 Mbps, and the useful
/// question is which rung a user on each leg would pick — the one comfortably *below* it, since
/// the leg has to carry the stream plus everything else on the line:
///
/// | link leg | the rung that fits |
/// |---|---|
/// | 17.5 Mbit/s | `1080p · 8 Mbps` (`P1080High`'s 20 does NOT fit — it is the rung for an uncapped LAN) |
/// | 7 Mbit/s | `720p · 4 Mbps` |
/// | 1 Mbit/s | `480p · 720 kbps` |
/// | 512 Kbit/s | **nothing** — it is below this ladder's floor, and no rung here pretends otherwise |
///
/// That last row is the honest one and it is why this table exists: three of these rungs carried a
/// comment claiming to sit "under" a leg they are numerically above, which would have sent the
/// next person tuning them to trust a false justification.
///
/// **Original is the migration-safe default and must stay a pure no-op**, which is what the
/// regression test at the foot of this file pins: with `Original` selected, every routing
/// decision and every query byte is what it was before this type existed. Auto is a distinct

///
/// This is the read-back half of `put_selection`: we have always written the user's pick to
/// `/library/parts/…` and never consulted the one already there, so a subtitle enabled from Plex
/// Web or a phone was dropped on the floor at every play. The ordinal is
/// `metadata::sub_render_ordinal`, i.e. the SAME identifier space the track menu commits and the
/// demuxer enumerates (embedded streams only, sorted on PMS `Stream.index`) — not a list position.
///
/// Unlike the audio rung this carries no "is it a real pick?" gate, because subtitles do have a
/// "nothing selected" state and use it: probed against the live server, parts carrying a
/// `default`-flagged subtitle come back with no selection at all, so a selection is a choice even
/// when it lands on the container default. The case that would blur it is an ACCOUNT-level
/// subtitle mode (always-show / auto-select forced), which makes PMS select a stream nobody
/// picked on this part — subtitles would then come up on every direct play of a foreign-audio
/// item. That is self-correcting (turning them off PUTs `subtitleStreamID=0`, which is a real
/// per-part override) and it is arguably the account setting working, but if it ever needs
/// suppressing, the gate belongs here — not on the flag itself.
///
/// Two deliberate limits, both about what the client renderer can actually deliver:
///   - an EXTERNAL (sidecar) selection returns None. It is not in the container, so nothing would
///     render; only a server burn can show it, and silently forcing a transcode to obey a stored
///     flag is not a trade the user asked for.
///   - this is the direct-play path only. The transcode path keeps PUTting `subtitleStreamID=0`
///     (subs off) as before: honouring a selection there means a server-side BURN, i.e. a
///     re-encode carrying a picture-quality cost, which is a trade to put behind the settings
///     surface this app does not have yet rather than to make silently at every play. Once a
///     direct-played item DOES go to the transcoder mid-session (a DTS/TrueHD audio pick), the
///     seeded `cur_sub_sid` rides along, so the subtitle already on screen keeps burning. Note the
///     read-back is therefore ONE-WAY on that path: an item that starts as a transcode still PUTs
///     `subtitleStreamID=0`, which not only suppresses the burn but CLEARS the server's selection
///     for everyone. That predates this change; honouring it instead is the same burn decision.

/// PURE: the local direct-play VIDEO test — the codec, the source's stated frame size and its

/// lists the decoder — anything else the pipeline cannot feed at all. The resolution half is the
/// local agreement with the profile's `*`-scoped `video.width`/`video.height` limitation: the
/// profile makes PMS transcode a 4K source down for a 1080p-bounded SoC, but the smart-DP branch
/// never asks PMS, so without this test a 4K file with one direct-playable audio track was fed
/// verbatim to a decoder whose table says 1920x1088 — the wrong-side failure devcaps' own doc
/// names (issue #22's over-claim class), invisible on the dev TV, whose bound is 4096x2176.
///
/// **The Dolby Vision half is the same shape of bug, found the same way, and it is NOT about the
/// decoder.** Every profile's base layer is ordinary HEVC and every one of them decodes here — so
/// a codec-name gate cannot see the difference, which is exactly why this one is needed. What
/// differs is whether the base layer MEANS anything on its own: Profile 8.1's does (it is HDR10,
/// and dropping the RPU costs only the dynamic metadata), Profile 5's does not (single-layer
/// IPT-PQ, no fallback — it decodes cleanly and displays in visibly wrong colours), and Profile
/// 7's is only half the picture.
///
/// **That half arrives here already DECIDED**, as a [`DvPresentation`] rather than as the raw
/// record, and that is the point: the same value the caller passes here is the value the Load
/// payload reads for its `DolbyHdrInfo` node. A stream we DECLARE is one the pipeline puts in
/// Dolby Vision mode, so Profile 5 direct-plays correctly and this gate must let it through; a
/// stream we do not declare falls back to `Dovi::base_layer_unusable`, the pre-declaration rule,
/// which carries the never-convict-on-silence reasoning. Taking the decision as an argument is
/// what makes "the gate and the payload can never disagree" checkable in one place —
/// [`Dovi::presentation`] — instead of being a coincidence between two functions.
///
/// **Refusing here is only half the work, and the other half is not in this function.** A refusal
/// sends the item down the transcode branch — but that branch's query grants PMS `directStream=1`,
/// permission to COPY the video rather than encode it, and the server takes it whenever the source
/// fits the caps: resolution, bitrate, and the profile's own limitation axes. None of those can say
/// "Dolby Vision", so a refused Profile 5 came back `Part.decision=transcode` with the video's own
/// decision `copy` — the same bitstream, the same wrong colours, one container down. `build_stream`
/// therefore also sets [`crate::plex::TranscodeSpec::no_video_copy`], off `base_layer_unusable` and
/// never off this gate: a COPY carries no declaration, so it stays wrong even for a profile we are
/// happy to direct-play. The measurement is in `docs/pms-api.md` §"What the server actually does
/// with a Dolby Vision source". A server that cannot encode the result is then allowed to say so —
/// this PMS answers general code 2000, *"File is unplayable. DoVi (Profile 5) color space is not
/// supported."*, which [`DvPresentation::Refuse`] turns into the player's read-out. A read-out that
/// names the reason is the honest end of that road; a picture in the wrong colours is not.
///
/// Unknown dimensions (0) PASS: PMS omitting a Media attribute is not evidence of 4K, and
