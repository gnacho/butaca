//! `net` — a small blocking HTTPS client over **whatever libcurl the machine already has**, bound
//! at runtime by the candidate list below (nothing is linked, and `stub/` — which this line named
//! for months after it was deleted — is gone). The plain-HTTP socket in [`crate::stream`] can
//! resolve names now, but it still cannot do TLS; this fills that gap. Every call is
//! **blocking**, so callers must run it off the SDL main loop (the account and PMS workers).
//!
//! **It is no longer the plex.tv transport alone**, and that line stood here while it was becoming
//! untrue. A PMS reached over the public internet is an `https://…plex.direct` origin — a NAME,
//! because that is what the certificate is issued for — so the whole PMS control plane comes
//! through here too whenever the origin is TLS. `crate::http` is the door that decides which of
//! the two transports a request takes; this module is only ever the https half of it. Direct
//! callers are `plex::account` and auth's public headerless QR-image fetch. It goes through
//! [`post_ca`]: CA-verified,
//! unpinned, bounded sink. **This list has stood here while becoming untrue before**, which is why
//! it is worth checking rather than trusting; that is twice.
//!
//! Only the curl *easy* API is used here; [`crate::curlio`] binds the multi API separately for the
//! media plane. This module owns their shared process init, including the mutex callbacks required
//! when the TV's libcurl uses OpenSSL 1.0. The option/info integer constants are curl's stable
//! public ABI values (kept here so we do not need the header). TLS peer+host verification is ON,
//! and `NOSIGNAL` is set because we call from threads. Response bodies never carry into a log here.

// ---- libcurl, bound at RUNTIME by SONAME candidate list ----
//
// The TV's libcurl SONAME is not stable across webOS: releases up to 6.4.0 answer to
// `libcurl.so.5`, and from 7.4.0 on only `libcurl.so.4` exists. Naming either in DT_NEEDED
// excludes half the fleet — and the exclusion is not "curl calls fail", it is the dynamic loader
// refusing to start the process. (5.3.1 and 6.4.0 carry BOTH names, a compat alias LG kept over
// the transition, which is why `.so.5` reached further than the file listing suggests.)
//
// The three setopt/getinfo wrappers share two C symbols via the macro's `= "name"` override. That
// is how the variadic API is bound: each call site passes exactly one trailing argument whose type
// is fixed by the option id, so one concrete non-variadic signature per call shape is both
// sufficient and what the compiler was already generating. This was hand-written once on the
// belief that a macro could not express it — the blocker was never the variadics, only the
// one-symbol-per-wrapper assumption.
//
// **The third name is macOS's, and it is what makes the desktop build able to SIGN IN.** The host
// simulator and the `PlxNative.app` bundle run this same module, and on a Mac the two ELF SONAMEs
// simply do not open — which is why signing in "did not work off-device" and was written up as an
// unfixable property of the simulator. It was one missing candidate: macOS ships libcurl in the
// dyld shared cache and `dlopen("libcurl.4.dylib")` resolves it with no install, no Homebrew and
// nothing to bundle (verified 2026-08-16: the handle opens and `curl_easy_setopt` resolves).
// It is LAST deliberately — a television never reaches it, so this costs the device nothing but
// one extra failed `dlopen` in the already-fatal no-curl case, and the candidate list stays
// ordered by "what the fleet actually answers to" first.
