//! Where the app's own files live — resolved at runtime, never hardcoded.
//!
//! webOS installs a native app under ONE of two prefixes, and which one is not ours to choose:
//!
//! | installed by | app dir | jail profile |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | LG Developer Mode (`ares-install`) | `/media/developer/apps/usr/palm/applications/<id>` | `jail_native_devmode.conf` |
//! | webOS Homebrew Channel | `/media/cryptofs/apps/usr/palm/applications/<id>` | `jail_native.conf` |
//!
//! The two jails differ in what is WRITABLE, which is the part that bites:
//! `jail_native_devmode.conf` does `mount rw /media/developer` + `mount ro /media/internal`;
//! `jail_native.conf` does the opposite and contains no `/media/developer` at all. So a path that
//! is correct under one install is missing under the other.
//!
//! Both failures used to be silent. Hardcoded font paths fell through to the system DroidSans
//! while `init_text` still logged `ok=1` — the whole `theme::size` ladder rendered in a face with
//! no bold companion, so every bold rung became synthetic emboldening applied after grid-fitting.
//! The session file's `open` returned ENOENT into a best-effort `save()` that dropped it, so the
//! user re-did the QR sign-in on every boot with a fresh client id each time.
//!
//! `/proc/self/exe` is the answer, not `$HOME`: LG's own jail conf sets `HOME` **twice** (once to
//! `$APPDIR`, once to `/media/developer`) and which one survives differs between the two profiles.
//! `/proc` is `mount rw` in both, and read from inside the jail the link resolves jail-relative —
//! exactly the path the app must use. Kodi's `CPlatformWebOS::GetHomePath()` does the same thing.

///   * `pkg/plxnative` stays ONE artifact. Nothing about the flavour reaches codegen, so there is
