//! Which webOS this television actually is — and the one thing the app ever ASKS the platform to
//! do, which is to take the screen back ([`go_home`]).
//!
//! # Why the app needs to know, when it never did before
//!
//! Until now the only thing it asked was "does `libAcbAPI` exist" (`starfish.c`'s `vp_mode`), which
//! splits the world at exactly webOS 5.0 and nowhere else. That was enough while 4.x was the only
//! target. It is not enough now: Kodi — which plays video on 5, 6 and 10 — carries gates at
//! `>= 6` (audio re-setup) and `< 11` / `>= 11` (a seek fallback, a changed signature), and with a
//! single boolean those are literally inexpressible here.
//!
//! The more immediate value is smaller and worth more: **a bug report from hardware nobody here
//! owns currently cannot say which firmware it came from.** The webOS 6/10 playback failure was
//! reported as one thing and is probably two, and the logs could not tell them apart.
//!
//! # Where it comes from
//!
//! `/var/run/nyx/os_info.json`, read once, at boot. Kodi asks
//! `luna://com.webos.service.config/getConfigs` for `tv.nyx.platformCode`; this is the same
//! information from the file nyx writes, and it needs no LS2 client, no subscription and no
//! thread. Verified present on the dev set (webOS 4.5), which reports:
//!
//! ```text
//! "webos_release": "4.10.2",  "webos_release_codename": "goldilocks2-grampians"
//! ```
//!
//! The CODENAME is the more useful half and is why this reads the file rather than a version
//! service: webosbrew's own compatibility data buckets firmware by codename, one library set per
//! bucket (their `library-version` guide — `goldilocks` is 4.0~4.4, `goldilocks2` 4.5~4.10). So
//! logging it says which of THEIR buckets a report belongs to, not just a number.
//!
//! Parsed by hand rather than through a JSON crate: this is a flat object of string values written
//! by the platform, the crate has no JSON dependency, and a parser that cannot fail is the right
//! shape for something that must never keep the app from booting.

/// reach the SDL loop, and `0x105`/`0x106` when the launcher tile brings it back), and the app
/// comes back as the SAME LIVE PROCESS. Not necessarily to the same picture, and not necessarily to

/// completed and routed on, and one this press had to restart (`app.rs::after_cancel`) shows a
/// fresh QR by design. The contract is the process, and everything else is whatever the app would
/// have been doing had nobody pressed anything.
///
/// # Why this is the platform's answer and not ours
///
/// LG's own back-button guide states the behaviour the platform performs when BACK is pressed at
/// an app's entry page: *"a popup asking whether to exit the app is displayed on webOS TV 6.0 or
/// higher, or the **Home launcher is launched** on webOS TV 5.0 or lower"*
/// (<https://webostv.developer.lge.com/develop/guides/back-button>, LG vendor documentation — it
/// describes the WEB runtime's `webOS.platformBack()`, which a native app cannot call, but it is
/// LG stating what the ROOT press means on this platform). The dev set is 4.10.2, so "launch the
/// Home launcher" is the behaviour to reproduce, and the app's previous "Exit PlxNative?" question
/// was the webOS 6+ shape applied to a webOS 4 television — and it quit, which even there is only
/// one of the two answers.
///
/// # The two mechanisms, in the order they are tried
///
/// 1. **SAM.** `luna://com.webos.applicationManager/launch` with the launcher's id. Same service
///    and method this repo already drives against this television from the Makefile and
///    `tools/tv-session.sh` (`launch`, `closeByAppId`), so the bus, the method and the payload
///    shape are device-proven; only the id is new. **Device-verified 2026-09-04 (webOS 4.10.2):**
///    `SAM accepted in 16ms`, and the launcher comes up as the RIBBON over the app — the app stays
///    on screen behind it, keeps drawing, keeps its pid, receives NO `LIFECYCLE: background`, and a
///    SAM `launch` of the app's own id brings it back with no ribbon. That is what the HOME key
///    does on this firmware, so it is the behaviour; this doc used to say launching Home
///    "backgrounds us", which is the webOS 5+ full-screen launcher's shape and not this set's. It
///    took a plain anonymous `LSRegister` to get there — [`ls2`]'s module doc has the table of
///    what the hub answers to each registration shape.
/// 2. **Minimize the surface.** `SDL_MinimizeWindow`, which on LG's SDL fork reaches the webOS
///    shell. The fork does bind that protocol: the harvested `libSDL2-2.0.so.0.4.1` off this set
///    carries `wl_webos_shell`, `wl_webos_shell_interface` and `wl_webos_shell_surface_interface`
///    in `.rodata`, and it is how `SDL_WEBOS_ACCESS_POLICY_KEYS_BACK` (set by `src/main.c`) becomes
///    the surface property that lets BACK reach this app at all. `wl_webos_shell_surface.set_state`
///    with `WL_WEBOS_SHELL_SURFACE_STATE_MINIMIZED = 1` is LG's own protocol
///    (`wayland-webos-shell-client-protocol.h` / `webos-shell.xml` in the NDK sysroot), and it is
///    what Kodi's webOS port drives from its `SetMinimized`. What is NOT proven from the binary is
///    that LG's fork wires `SDL_MinimizeWindow` to it — the library is stripped and the driver's
///    hook is an internal function pointer — so this is the FALLBACK and not the mechanism: SDL's
///    own contract makes an unimplemented hook a silent no-op, which is the correct failure here.
///
/// If BOTH legs fail the user stays exactly where they were, which is the right last resort: the
/// alternative is ending the process, and "must not terminate the application" is the whole of what
/// was asked for. `SDL_MinimizeWindow` returns void, so the app cannot even know the second leg
/// failed — the log line says what was ASKED, never that it worked, and the screenshot is what

/// | registration | after `acb_init` (2026-09-04) | at boot (2026-09-10) |
/// |---|---|---|
/// | `LSRegisterApplicationService(app_id, app_id)` | `-1028 Attempted to register for a service name that already exists` | **`-1027 Invalid permissions for <app id>`** |
/// | `LSRegisterApplicationService(NULL, app_id)` | `-1027 Invalid permissions for (null)` | `-1027 Invalid permissions for (null)` |
/// | **`LSRegister(NULL)`** | registered, and `com.webos.applicationManager/getForegroundAppInfo` answered it | same |
/// | `LSRegister(app_id)` | not tried | **not tried until now** — see [`register_named`] |
///
/// **`-1027` for `name=NULL` at boot is what makes the app-service column a verdict on the API
/// rather than on the name**: that shape asks for no name at all, so there is nothing for the hub
/// to have found taken, and the app id was demonstrably free at that instant (`acb create=1`
/// appears 29 lines later). The role file appinstalld generates lists BOTH `""` and the app id in
/// `allowedNames` and grants the app id `outbound: ["*"]`, and `LSRegister(NULL)` — which takes
/// `""` off that same list — registers and completes an outbound call. So on this firmware
/// `LSRegisterApplicationService` is refused for a `type: "regular"` dev-mode role whatever name
/// it is handed, while `LSRegister` is granted.
///
/// That is precisely why [`register_named`] exists: `LSRegister(app_id)` is the shape the role
/// file's `allowedNames` should permit AND the shape that gives the hub a sender service name —
/// the second key of LG's key-manager ownership rule (application id > sender service name). It
/// is **untested on any television** as of 2026-09-10; [`probe`] is what settles it.
///
/// So [`register`], the plain anonymous client, is what every caller but `keymanager` takes. The
/// role file still decides what such a client may CALL — the probe proves SAM's read-only method;
/// `launch_home` grades the reply of the one that matters — and the hub's refusal, when there is
/// one, travels in [`RegisterFail`] to the caller's log line instead of being freed. Anonymous
/// clients do not collide with each other, so nothing here is serialised; a registration lives
/// for one caller's use and is unregistered on drop, as both copies always did.
///
/// **One caller needs an identity, and it now has three shapes to ask through.** `keymanager`
/// keys nothing of its own by identity — LG's key manager keys ITS keys by the caller's, so an
/// anonymous client owns a different key every launch (issue #76). Since 2026-09-10 that one
/// caller asks for [`register_app_service`] (`LSRegisterApplicationService(app_id, app_id)`),
/// then [`register_named`] (`LSRegister(app_id)`), and falls back to [`register`] on any refusal;
/// `keymanager`'s module doc owns the rule, including why the decision is gated on whether THIS
/// firmware has an ACB to hold the name rather than on the hub's reply. **Both named shapes are
