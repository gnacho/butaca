//! The **plex.tv account** API — the login (PIN/QR), server discovery, and Plex Home managed-user
//! surface. This is a *different service* from the Plex Media Server: the repo's OpenAPI spec
//! (`docs/plex-openapi.json`) is PMS-only and every PMS op assumes you already hold a token, so
//! these endpoints have no entry there. They're modelled here in the same typed style as the rest
//! of the `plex` layer (`hubs.rs`/`library.rs`): typed methods returning serde DTOs, with all the
//! transport, identity headers, and token injection centralised on [`AccountClient`].
//!
//! Transport is [`crate::net`] (libcurl HTTPS) — the TLS analog of `stream::http_get`, since plex.tv
//! needs DNS + TLS that the plain-HTTP PMS socket can't do. Every call is **blocking**, so callers
//! run it on a background thread (the login-poll / discovery / switch threads), never the SDL loop.
//!
//! Tokens (`Pin.auth_token`, `Resource.access_token`, `SwitchedUser.auth_token`) are secrets: they
//! are never logged here and never printed by callers. What IS logged, on a failure only, is the
//! **status**, the **shape** of the endpoint that returned it, and — for a body that will not
//! deserialize — serde's error category and position. See [`decode`] for why the status is worth a
//! line at all, and [`endpoint_shape`] for what a "shape" is allowed to contain.
//!
//! `discover.rs` is this client's op-file sibling: the plex.tv **metadata provider** speaks the
//! same transport and the same identity headers, so it adds an `impl AccountClient` block rather
//! than a second client — which is why [`AccountClient::get`] is `pub(super)`.
