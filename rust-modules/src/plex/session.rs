//! Persisted login session — what makes the client **offline-first**. After the one-time online
//! login (account token → server discovery → profile switch), the chosen server's verified
//! [`Origin`] and the profile's token are written here. A stable build can therefore resume a
//! stored HTTPS origin without plex.tv when it remains reachable; an explicit developer-trigger
//! build may also resume a plaintext HTTP origin for lab use. Lives in the writable app dir (device-only; never in the
//! repo). The token fields are secrets — this file's contents are never logged.
//!
//! ## One server, and then the ROSTER
//!
//! [`Session::server`] is still the primary — the one address `can_go_local` runs on and the one
//! `app.rs` boots against — and refresh keeps its origin/tier aligned with the roster. Beside it,
//! [`Session::sources`] records **every**
//! server discovery reached, ours and every share, each with its own address and its own
//! per-(user, server) token, because a shared server is a separate authority that answers 401 to
//! anybody else's credential (`docs/shared-servers.md` §2b). A single-server account writes one
//! entry there and behaves exactly as it always has.
//!
//! **Nothing here carries a timestamp**, deliberately: this TV's wall clock runs ~3 h skewed
//! (`docs/agent-reference.md`), so a stored "last seen" would be a number that cannot be compared with
//! anything and would invite an expiry rule built on it.
//!
//! ## Storage: encrypted when it can be, 0600 always, and STAYS 0600 once refused
//!
//! [`save`] asks `keymanager::seal` to device-key-encrypt the file and falls back to a mode-0600
//! plaintext file when no usable Key Manager is available. **Once an install has proven it cannot
//! read its own sealed envelope back — [`LOCKED_RECOVERABLE`], issue #76 — that install keeps the
//! 0600 file until sign-out or erase**, never only for the one launch that found it: the verdict is
//! recorded in a small on-disk marker (see [`write_refused_marker`]) precisely because a backend
//! that round-trips fine WITHIN one launch can still be the same one that sealed the now-unreadable
//! envelope, and re-sealing on that evidence alone reproduces the loop one launch later.
//! [`clear`] removes the marker with the session, so a different account or a future firmware gets
//! a fresh chance.
//!
//! **"Proven it cannot read it back" means a key manager ANSWERED and said no.** A service that
//! did not answer at all — a stalled call, a registration that never reached the bus, a hub
//! reporting no such service — has proven nothing about the key, and costing a working sealed
//! sign-in over one such boot is the failure this module used to have: see [`LOCKED_UNAVAILABLE`],
//! which keeps the envelope, tells the sign-in screen to offer *Try again*, and settles into the
//! refusal above only after [`UNAVAILABLE_MAX_LAUNCHES`] launches have ended the same way.
//!
//! ## Storage model: one file, two honest states, sealing that is EARNED
//!
//! Decided 2026-09-10 against a decompile of how Apple TV, Prime Video, Netflix and YouTube protect
//! their own stored sign-in on this same television
//! (`docs/measurements/credential-storage-native-apps-2026-09-10.md`): keymanager3 stays the sealed
//! state, there is one file path, and it is always in one of exactly two honest states — **sealed**,
//! where keymanager3 has *proven* (not merely attempted) that it round-trips across a launch, or
//! **0600 plaintext**, everywhere else. No per-install key beside the data (adds nothing a peer
//! process running as our own uid could not already read) and no address/serial-derived key (worse:
//! every process on the box can read those inputs). See [`LOCKED_RECOVERABLE`] /
//! [`write_refused_marker`] / [`plant_probe`] above for the earning mechanism itself.
//!
//! **The shared `/media/developer` namespace is not this module's threat model to solve.** It is
//! measured `drwxrwxrwx root:root` (0777, no sticky bit observed) — every Developer Mode app has
//! its own uid but shares that one directory and its one gid, so 0600 is the whole boundary a
//! *mode* can draw, and a peer app can still unlink or rename a name it cannot read
//! (`write_atomic`'s `O_NOFOLLOW` + `create_new` and `read_owned_regular`'s ownership check are
//! what turn a FOREIGN or symlinked substitution into "rejected", not "parsed as ours" — see the
//! next paragraph for what that guarantee does NOT cover). `repair_owned_mode`
//! narrows the remaining risk one step further: an OWNED regular file found with any group/other
//! bit set is fixed to 0600 in place (via `fchmod` on the already-open, already-checked fd — never
//! a `chmod` by path) rather than refused, because refusing was itself a bug — see the 2026-09-10
//! commit that closed it, and [`ModeTrust`]'s doc for what a *write*-widened mode additionally costs
//! the CONTENT, not merely the file's disclosure. SECURITY.md states the exposure for retail
//! (jailed to `mountappdir`, no shared namespace at all) against Developer Mode explicitly.
//!
//! **Parent directories, and what `O_NOFOLLOW` does and does not reach.** `O_NOFOLLOW` on the final
//! `open(2)` defeats a symlink swapped in at the LEAF name — it says nothing about who can write to
//! the directory that name lives in, and every candidate here passes through one of three parents
//! with a different owner:
//! - `/media/developer` — measured (device read, 2026-09-10) `drwxrwxrwx` **root:root**, no sticky
//!   bit. Every Developer Mode app's own uid can create, rename or unlink entries directly under
//!   it, this install's own files included.
//! - `/media/internal` — `mount ro` under THIS app's own jail profile (`jail_native_devmode.conf`),
//!   `mount rw` under the retail profile (`jail_native.conf`) that never runs on this shared
//!   namespace at all. Its owning uid/gid and mode were **not independently measured on this
//!   device** — unlike `/media/developer` there is no `ls -la` reading of it in
//!   `docs/measurements/` — so nothing beyond the jail's own mount flag is claimed about it here.
//! - This install's own directory (`paths::app_dir()`/`in_app_dir`) — on Developer Mode this
//!   directory is ITSELF a subdirectory *inside* the shared `/media/developer` tree
//!   (`/media/developer/apps/usr/palm/applications/<id>/`), so a peer able to write into its own
//!   enclosing `.../applications/` directory could in principle rename or replace this install's
//!   directory entry too — that exact node was not separately measured, but nothing about
//!   `/media/developer`'s own measured mode narrows it. On a retail install, `mountappdir` puts
//!   only this app's own directory in the mount namespace at all, so this concern does not apply
//!   there.
//!
//! **What ownership + mode checks cannot see: a replay.** A peer with rename rights in
//! `/media/developer` can move this install's own, currently-valid, correctly-owned, correctly-
//! 0600 file ASIDE, let this install write a fresh one, and later move the old bytes back. The
//! replayed copy is genuinely ours by every check this module makes — same uid, same regular file,
//! same 0600 mode, a session/consent shape this build parses fine — so it loads as though it were
//! current. **This is a known, undetected limitation, not a guarantee this module makes**; earlier
//! prose in this file and elsewhere describing a substituted name as always "rejected" was talking
//! about a FOREIGN or symlinked substitution (which the ownership/regular-file check does catch),
//! never about a stale-but-genuine replay (which it structurally cannot). See
//! `tests::a_replayed_older_valid_session_file_is_indistinguishable_from_current` (this module's
//! own tests) for a test that pins the limitation, and SECURITY.md / `docs/install-and-verify.md` for
//! the same statement outside the source tree.
//!
//! **What each shipped version actually wrote, and what this build does when it finds it:**
//!
//! | on disk | v0.6.0 / v0.6.1 wrote it as | v0.6.2 added | this build reads it as |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | bare `Session` JSON, 0600 | the only shape that ever existed | — | `Ready{plaintext:true}` |
//! | `SecureEnvelope{format,version:1,sealed}` that opens | wrote it opportunistically, no earning, no marker | — | `Ready{plaintext:false}`, promoted |
//! | same envelope, locked (keymanager3 REFUSED to open it — a real reply, a tag mismatch) | silently re-asked for sign-in every launch (issue #76) — no marker, no recovery | persisted `secure-storage.refused` marker + per-process lock detection | `LOCKED_RECOVERABLE`; a fresh sign-in recovers it |
//! | same envelope, and the key service simply did NOT ANSWER (timeout, failed registration, no such service) | as above — treated as a refusal, so one stalled boot cost the install its sealed storage for good | as above | `LOCKED_UNAVAILABLE`: the envelope is left byte-identical and the sign-in screen offers *Try again*. Bounded by a transient, content-only `secure-storage.unavailable` LAUNCH COUNTER (not the cross-launch refused marker) — after `UNAVAILABLE_MAX_LAUNCHES` such launches it is finally graded the refusal above. An `IdentityUnavailable` open shares none of this counter and never escalates, however many launches it recurs on — see `note_service_unavailable`'s doc. **A FRESH SIGN-IN made while the service is still unanswerable does not wait for any of that** (0.6.4): the seal is attempted, and when that is silent too the 0600 file replaces the envelope at the candidate it was found at, because a sign-in nobody can read back is the worst outcome available — issue #76's second field report, "account name shows at the top, but after a restart I must sign in again" |
//! | secure-shaped file, unrecognized format/version | n/a (format didn't exist yet) | n/a | `LOCKED_UNRECOVERABLE`; **never written over at all** — not as plaintext, and since 2026-09-10 not as a fresh envelope either, on a proven install or any other (`has_unrecognized_secure_envelope`), and since 2026-09-11 not DELETED either when it sits at a candidate this install does not read (`sweep_other_candidates`). Only `clear` removes it |
//! | `secure-storage.refused` marker, no `secure-storage.proven` | n/a | wrote the marker; nothing yet read `proven` | plaintext, durably — `plant_probe` returns immediately while a refused marker exists (see its doc), so a v0.6.2 install stays on the 0600 file forever unless the account signs out; only `clear` removes the marker and reopens the earning path |
//! | this branch's probe/proven files | n/a | n/a | the only inputs that can promote an install to sealing at all |
//!
//! A file this build cannot make sense of is never guessed at, and the two shapes of that differ
//! in exactly one respect. A secure envelope of an unrecognized format or version
//! (`LOCKED_UNRECOVERABLE`) is never replaced by anything this build writes — a fresh sign-in
//! included — because it may be a NEWER build's envelope that will read perfectly again after the
//! upgrade; `clear` (sign out / Delete all local data) is the only thing that removes it. An
//! envelope this build DID open, whose plaintext is not a session (`LOCKED_CORRUPT`), is ours and
//! proven dead, so an explicit fresh sign-in may replace it and nothing else may.

/// **[`LOCKED_UNAVAILABLE`] is deliberately in NEITHER, and that has not changed** — a transient

/// writes a fresh envelope in the ordinary way, and this gate is what keeps that possible: putting

/// stalled boot, which is the very thing the state exists to prevent.

/// **What changed in 0.6.4 is the other side of that save, and it is not this function's to
/// decide.** A save that reaches [`save_locked`]'s dead ends with the service *still* silent —
/// either the unproven "a secure file is present" branch or the post-seal-failure one — and that
/// carries a completed sign-in now recovers to the 0600 file at the candidate the envelope was

/// this gate draws is therefore between "may we ASK the key manager" (yes, always, for a
/// transient) and "what do we do once asking has failed" (the caller's, on the evidence of that
/// failure). Issue #76's second field report is what the old answer cost: the sign-in lived for

/// service has proven nothing about the key, so the seal is attempted first and the recovery is
/// what happens when even that comes back silent. See [`save_locked`]'s branches and
/// [`seal_permitted`]'s doc for why those two orders differ.
///
/// **The verdict outlives the launch that found it.** A per-process refusal alone would only ever
/// interrupt the loop for one boot — issue #76's own robustness review measured the sequence
/// (`docs/…` — see the module doc's cross-launch paragraph): launch 2 recovers to plaintext, but
/// launch 3 reads that plaintext cleanly, so ITS OWN [`LOCKED_STATE`] never becomes
/// [`LOCKED_RECOVERABLE`] — and if the key manager happens to round-trip fine within launch 3 (the
/// exact "works per-launch, not across launches" shape the bug reports describe), an ordinary
/// `update()` (a roster refresh, a pin) re-seals it, and launch 4 is locked again. So once
/// [`read_locked`] proves an envelope unopenable, that fact is ALSO written to a small 0600 marker
/// beside the session file (see [`write_refused_marker`]) — content only, never key material —
/// and every later save on this install, this launch's or any other's, checks it before ever
/// calling `keymanager::seal`. An install that has once failed to read its own envelope back stays
/// on the 0600 file until [`clear`] (sign-out or erase), which removes the marker together with
/// the session — a different account, or a future firmware, gets a fresh chance.
///
/// The mode is set in `open(2)`'s own argument — never create-then-chmod. `fs::write` creates with
/// `0666 & !umask` (0644 here), so a fallback token file would be readable by every other uid from

/// **Returns WHAT it did, not merely whether it worked** — [`PersistOutcome`], which

/// only atomic within one filesystem, and the webOS jail's writable directories are separate mounts
/// (`/media/developer`, `/media/internal`, the app dir — see [`auth_paths`]); a tmp under `/tmp`
/// would demote this to a cross-device copy, i.e. exactly the truncate-in-place it replaces. Its
/// suffix is random and opened with `create_new` + `O_NOFOLLOW`: the module lock serializes our
/// writers, but it does not serialize another uid able to create a sibling entry.
///
/// `sync_all` before the rename and on the parent after it is what makes the promise survive the
/// plug being pulled, which on a
/// television is an ordinary way to end a session: without it the rename can be visible while the
/// data behind it is not, and the file that comes back is the empty one. It costs a flush of a
/// couple of kilobytes on a path that runs at sign-in, at a profile switch, at a roster change and
/// at a committed search term — never per frame.
///
/// The 0600 mode is [`save`]'s rule applied one file earlier: the secret must never *exist* in a
/// permissive mode, and the tmp file is where it exists first.
/// `pub(crate)` since 2026-08-29 so `crate::telemetry` writes its file the same way rather than
/// growing a second implementation of this. It is a generic 0600 atomic write that happens to live

    // own: `keymanager::seal`'s round-trip proof is IN-PROCESS, so a fresh sign-in on a backend
    // whose key is not usable from a DIFFERENT launch (or LS2 registration) seals cleanly, looks
    // perfectly healthy, and is unreadable the moment the television is power-cycled. These tests
    // pin the fix — a save never seals the REAL session until a PRIOR launch has proven a small,
    // non-secret probe envelope reopens; until then every save stays on the 0600 file and tries to
    // leave a probe of its own for the next launch to check (see `plant_probe`/`check_probe`).
