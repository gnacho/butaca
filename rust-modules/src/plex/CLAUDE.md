# plex/ — the Plex data layer (typed PMS + plex.tv client)

This is the **typed Plex client**: account/login (`account.rs`, `session.rs`), the HTTP client
(`client.rs` — one server) and the registry that holds them (`servers.rs` — WHICH servers exist and
which is current, with `probe.rs` deciding which of a server's addresses is worth dialling),
library/hubs/metadata reads (`library.rs`/`hubs.rs`/`models.rs`), and the whole
playback protocol — the MDE/transcode decision + capability profile (`transcoder.rs`), the
timeline/PlayQueue/identity session ops (`timeline.rs`), stream selection + the direct-play
target (`library.rs`), with typed request params in `params.rs`. **Every PMS query in the app
is built here** (route.rs holds playback *state* + policy, never a query string). The
authoritative REST spec is **`docs/pms-api.md`** (verified) — read it before adding an
endpoint; don't reverse-engineer PMS from scratch.

## The guiding principle: direct-play first

The whole point of this client is that **the TV plays the library natively**. Prefer a **direct-play**
part over a transcode wherever the TV can decode it; when a transcode is unavoidable, request it as a
**progressive stream the existing demuxer already handles** (H264+AC3 MKV) rather than inventing a new
container/codec path. Every "just transcode it" shortcut pushes work onto the server *and* degrades
quality — reach for it only when direct-play genuinely can't work. See `[[server-hevc-encode-gating]]`
and the `soft-subs` note below for why "direct-play everything" keeps paying off.

## More than one server: the registry (`servers.rs`)

**A friend's shared server is not a second address, it is a second AUTHORITY** — its own
`machineIdentifier`, its own per-(user, server) `accessToken`, its own `ratingKey` space and its own
watch state. Measured live against a real share (`docs/shared-servers.md` §2): our own server's
token gets a **401** from it, and its section key `1` is a different library from our section key
`1`. So this layer is keyed on servers, not on one host and port.

`client()` and `client_opt()` still mean what they always did, they just mean **the CURRENT
server** now — which is why nothing outside `plex/` changed when the `OnceLock<Client>` singleton
became a table. `client_for(id)` is the multi-server addition; `register_origin(machine_id,
&Origin, token)` puts a server in the table; `install(&Origin, token)` is the SESSION path (boot, QR
login, profile switch) and always retargets.

**A server's address is an `Origin` — scheme + host + port — and it is PARSED FROM A URL, never
assembled from an address.** `origin.rs` is the type and the reasoning; the short version is that
plex.tv advertises a server's TLS origin as the `plex.direct` HOSTNAME (`Connection.uri`) while
`Connection.address` stays the dotted quad behind it, and the certificate is issued for the name —
so a control plane carrying only an address can never validate one, however much TLS is added
underneath it. `probe::Candidate::origin()` is the one derivation, and `Candidate::address` survives
only as what a log and the Sources panel SAY. Two invariants come with it: `Origin::host()` is
**always unbracketed** (it is the `getaddrinfo` node) while `Origin::authority()` **always**
brackets a v6 literal (it is URL serialization) — confusing the two makes URL construction keep
looking right while name resolution quietly stops working. `register(machine_id, host, port, token)`
and `Origin::http(host, port)` still exist and are honest about what they mean: **every caller of
either is a place that still assumes cleartext**, which is what makes them the grep for the TLS
work. The CONTROL plane no longer makes that assumption: `http.rs` sends an HTTPS origin through
libcurl. Neither does playback: `StreamUrl` preserves the scheme and `ff.rs` selects `stream.rs`
for plaintext or `curlio.rs` for HTTPS. One dev-only caller also still throws an origin away:
`ui/alt_sources.rs`'s `stand_in_slot` registers a stand-in from `c.host()`/`c.port()` and must move
to `register_origin` in that UI-owned lane.

Slots are keyed on `machineIdentifier` because that is the only identity that survives a server
changing address — and a registration that has *learned* an id **adopts** an address-only slot
instead of adding a second one for the same machine.

Three design choices carry the weight, and each is a prevented bug rather than a preference:

- **An atomic-pointer table, not an `RwLock`.** `client()` is a HOT path: `posters::poster_key`
  calls it **three times per key, for every visible art tile, every frame** (~25–40 tiles × 60 fps).
  A read is one relaxed load, one acquire load, a deref — no lock, no refcount, no allocation. An
  `RwLock` would add an atomic RMW pair per call plus a fairness stall every time a login writes,
  and an `Arc` would change every call site's type to buy a refcount bump per tile per frame.
- **Each slot's `Client` is LEAKED, deliberately.** That is what makes handing out `&'static
  Client` sound without an `Arc`: the reference a worker took at frame N must still be valid when a
  re-point lands at frame N+1 with that worker mid-request. Re-pointing publishes a NEW leaked
  `Client` over the pointer, so the worst case for the old reference is **one request sent to where
  that server used to be** — never a dangling pointer, which is the failure that has no debugger on
  this device. The leak is bounded: a handful of small structs, written on login / profile switch /
  server switch, never per frame.
- **Token generations come from a process-global sequence, so no two clients ever share one.**
  `token_gen` was a single process-wide counter, which cannot express "server B's token changed".
  Its only reader is `posters::poster_key`'s memo and that memo compares **one number** — so two
  servers whose generations happened to agree would mean that the moment `client()` started
  answering with B, the memo said nothing had changed and served B its cards from **A's memoised,
  token-bearing paths**. Uniqueness makes "did this number move" also answer "is this even the same
  server".

## Granted, pinned, reachable — three states, and never the same question

The whole shared-source feature rests on keeping these apart:

- **granted** — plex.tv's answer. `/api/v2/resources` says this account may use this server and
  hands over the `accessToken` that proves it. Not a setting of ours; it is the owner's decision.
- **pinned** — the only thing the USER controls, it governs **Home only**, and it is **per Plex
  Home PROFILE**. Tabs, the browse grid, sort, the A–Z rail and every other browsing surface come
  from the grant; pinning decides whether a source's shelves merge into Home. The rules are
  `pins.rs` (pure); the store is `Session::home_pins`, keyed by the profile's `uuid`; the first-run
  route that asks the question once is `ui::onboard`. Owner's ruling, 2026-08-21 — "it is separate
  for each profile" — and it hung off the whole `Session` (one per install) before that.
- **reachable** — a fact about NOW: something answered at one of its addresses, *as the right
  machine*. It changes while nobody touches anything, and it is never a reason to forget the grant
  or the pin.

Collapsing any two of them produces a specific wrong behaviour rather than a vague one. A `401` is
the final answer only when no parallel direct or fallback relay candidate verifies the machine; at
that point reading it as "unreachable" sends the user to the router when the fix is to refetch
`/resources` or correct the access policy. An unreachable server read as un-granted drops the
source out of the Sources list, so there is nothing left to retry.
A pinned-but-dead source drawn as a shelf is a spinner that never ends — the design's answer is that
a dead source is **absent** from Home and states itself in its own library section instead.

## Gotchas that bite (all verified in code)

- **`Connection.local` does not mean what it looks like, and the cost is a probe deadline.** It means
  "this address is RFC1918", NOT "you are on that LAN" — a share advertises the *owner's*
  `172.20.x.x`. `publicAddressMatches` is the field that means the latter. For an unmatched
  non-owned connection, `probe.rs` retains only an advertised HTTPS URI and suppresses plaintext:
  TLS plus the `/identity` response can authenticate the answer, while plaintext could succeed
  against a different machine at the same address on our LAN. That is also why a probe must
  **verify `machineIdentifier` on the response** before accepting a connection, and why `probe.rs`
  is pure (no socket, no clock): the rules are then gradeable on the dev Mac.
- **A ceiling is answered by the transcode FLAVOR *first*, and only then by a parameter.** Plex's
  relay is a ~2 Mbit/s tunnel, so `transcoder::link_policy` denies direct play *and* the container
  remux over one — the remux is the half that is easy to miss, since it copies the codecs and
  deliberately sends no cap, i.e. the same bytes at the same rate one layer down. **No relay
  connection has ever been observed by this codebase**, so that policy is reasoned, not measured;
  read its doc before touching it.
  `TranscodeSpec` grew a `ceiling` field on 2026-08-23 and this bullet used to end "and must not
  grow one" — which was right about a LINK ceiling and wrong as a general rule. A **user-chosen**
  ceiling (`route::Quality`, the picker in the player's `…` menu, for LG checklist #43 CASE1) is a
  different input with the identical mechanism: `route::quality_policy` returns the same two flags
  `link_policy` does, `route::flavors_allowed` composes them so the stricter wins, and only once
  direct play and the remux are BOTH denied does a rate reach the WIRE. Note the field itself rides
  EVERY spec, remux included — `transcode_query` reads it on the re-encode branch alone, and the
  remux branch's silence is an invariant a host test pins, not a `None` you can rely on. The rule that
  survives unchanged is the ORDER: a number that is not preceded by a flavour refusal does nothing
  at all, because the flavour it would have bound is the one with no encoder in it.
- **Capture the server at the SPAWN SITE**, the rule the multi-server work inherits from
  `route::ResolveEnv` — whose doc says why in general: a worker reads no `static mut`, because the
  main thread reassigns those under it. "Which server is current" is exactly such a value, and a
  worker that asks *after* the user switched lands an answer belonging to the other machine's
  `ratingKey` space. Pass a `ServerId` (or the `&'static Client`) in with the job. One narrow
  exception exists today and is worth knowing rather than copying: `build_stream` reads
  `client_opt()` on the resolve worker. That is sound — the registry read is atomic and its clients
  are never freed — but it means "the current server", not "the server this play started from", and
  it is the line to change when a play can begin on a server that is not current.

- **Content negotiation: send `Accept: application/json` explicitly.** PMS returns **XML** for
  `Accept: */*` (or no Accept), and only JSON for an explicit `application/json`. A request that
  forgets it silently gets XML → the JSON parser finds no `Metadata` → **0 items, empty home**. The
  raw-socket `stream.rs` used to force `*/*` on every request; the client sends JSON Accept unless the
  caller overrides it (playback/part/photo endpoints ignore Accept).
- **PMS string-encodes numbers, so deserializers must be lenient.** Fields like `size`/`viewOffset`/
  `duration` arrive as JSON **strings** (`"1234"`) on some endpoints and **numbers** on others; some
  bools (`Stream.default`/`selected`) arrive as `true`/`false` *and* as `"1"`/`"0"`. Every numeric
  field goes through `de_i64`/`de_f64` (in `models.rs`) whose untagged enum accepts int **and** string
  **and** bool. Omitting a lenient adapter doesn't just drop one field — serde fails the **whole
  `MediaContainer`** parse → empty result. When you add a model field, use the lenient adapter.
- **The session file has FOUR writers and exactly one door for changing part of it.** `session.rs`'s
  `update(|s| …)` does the read-modify-write under the module's own lock and writes through a
  sibling tmp + `rename`; `save` is a whole-file REPLACE for the two flows that own the entire file
  (sign-in, profile switch). Reach for `update` for anything that touches one field — the roster,
  the search terms — because the others are workers and the two failures are both silent: a lost
  update resumes the next boot as the wrong profile, and a torn `O_TRUNC` write is an unparseable
  file, which is a QR code on the next boot rather than a stale roster. The disk lock is held across
  the write's `sync_all`; initialized `peek`/`load` reads bypass it through an in-memory RwLock
  snapshot. **Nothing per-frame may read the disk file**; cache derived views (as
  `ui::search::recents` does, keyed on `session::current_gen`).
- **Track selection is server-side, via `PUT /library/parts/{id}`** (set the chosen audio/subtitle
  stream + subtitle burn), **not** query params on the stream URL. The server re-selects for the next
  decision; the client re-requests the part. See `[[audio-subtitle-track-switching]]`.
- **Subtitles: assume client rendering, not the server.** WebVTT sidecars do **not** deliver on our
  progressive-MKV pipeline (they come back empty / 501), so during a transcode the only server option
  is **burn** — which is why direct-play + our own subtitle renderer (see `player/`) is the real
  answer. Don't add a soft-subtitle path that only works on paper. See `[[soft-subs-during-transcode]]`.

## Where the bytes go next

This layer only *decides and locates*; the actual byte stream (direct-play or transcode) is pulled
through `stream.rs` or `curlio.rs`, demuxed by `ff.rs`, and fed to Starfish by the `player/` engine
— see `player/CLAUDE.md` for the Load-payload/codec and subtitle-rendering rules on the other side
of the handoff. The old hand-rolled `mkv.rs` path is retired.
