//! Typed Plex API layer — one method per PMS operation the app uses.
//!
//! Replaces every hand-built Plex path/query string in the app with a typed `Client`
//! method (see `docs/plex-api-design.md` + `docs/plex-api-catalog.md`). Percent-encoding
//! (`crate::pms::urlenc_str`), the `X-Plex-Token` injection, and the origin-aware HTTP(S)
//! transport (`crate::http`) are centralised in `client.rs`, so no op file can bypass them.
//! Response bodies deserialize into `serde` DTOs (`models.rs`).
//!
//! The WHOLE surface is live: `plex::install` is called at boot/login (`app.rs`, `auth.rs`);
//! the read layer (`pms`/`metadata`/`posters`/`detail`) and the playback layer (`route.rs`
//! decision/start/stop/selection, PlayQueue/identity, and the player's `/:/timeline`) all go
//! through `client()` (history: `docs/plex-api-migration.md`). The module-wide allow covers
//! the ops written ahead of a UI feature (browse/leaves — no callers yet). `search` had one
//! too until the Search screen landed and `crate::search` began calling it; the name was left
//! in this list for several commits afterwards, long enough for a test-manifest note to cite
//! it as the check for whether that screen existed.
