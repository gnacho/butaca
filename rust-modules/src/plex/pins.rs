//! **Which libraries feed Home — the rules, pure.**
//!
//! The store is [`browse`](crate::browse)'s section table (in memory, indexed by the app) and
//! [`Session::home_pins`](super::session::Session::home_pins) (on disk, keyed by profile). This
//! module is neither: it is the policy between them, kept free of both so every rule below is
//! graded by `cargo test --lib` rather than observed on a television.
//!
//! `browse.rs` referred to a `pin::resolve` for a week before one existed — the comment describing
//! this file was written when the pin default was hard-wired to `true` because deliverable F (the
//! first-run route) had nowhere to ask the question. It has one now, and these are its rules:
//!
//! * **Your own libraries arrive On, a friend's arrive Off.** The point of asking is not to put a
//!   stranger's shelves on your front door unannounced (`Shared Sources.dc.html` §F).
//! * **An account with no server of its own is not a special case.** Every source it has is
//!   borrowed, so "a friend's arrives Off" would open the app on nothing at all; with nothing of
//!   your own to prefer, a borrowed library is simply a library.
//! * **A recorded answer beats the default**, in both directions — which is why
//!   [`HomePins`](super::session::HomePins) records the Offs too. A library nobody was asked about
//!   (a share that answered late, one the owner created since) lands on its default instead of
//!   silently Off, and that is what makes "a share arriving later does not reopen this screen"
//!   honest rather than merely quiet.
//! * **Home is never empty.** The one state the control genuinely has no answer for, and the reason
//!   the Home editor's draft refuses to unpin the last library (`ui::onboard::toggle_draft`; the
//!   test-only `browse::toggle_pin` keeps the same floor). The same floor is applied here,
//!   because a *recorded* selection can be emptied without any toggle at all: unpin your own
//!   libraries in favour of a friend's, then lose the friend from the roster.
