// ============================== backdrop blur ================================
// The frosted ground under a popover panel: a blurred snapshot of what the frame had drawn BEHIND
// it, sampled through the panel's own rounded rect. `track_menu.rs` carried "no true backdrop blur
// on the GLES plane" as a standing assumption for a year; this is what replaces it.
//
// Four facts shape the whole design.
//
// 1. **Snapshots are cached.** A popover over a still page captures on open and then costs one
//    textured quad per drawn frame. A surface over a MOVING page opts into
//    `widgets::Glass::DYNAMIC_BACKDROP`, which invalidates on the shared cadence while its underlay
//    is dirty; the widget still draws every present.
//    Capturing every present was measured at 52.6 fps on the dev television and is not supported.
// 2. **The capture is MID-FRAME.** `Painter`'s primitives are immediate GL calls, so the default
//    framebuffer already holds exactly the prepared page with its page-drawn overlay scrim
//    at the moment the panel is about to draw.
//    That is the only reason no render-target restructuring is needed: the "background" is a
//    definition of *when*, not of *what*.
//    **A tested and REJECTED hypothesis lives here**, recorded because it is the obvious next idea
//    and it is wrong on this part: that a mid-frame framebuffer read is expensive *because it is
//    mid-frame* — a tiler must resolve the frame's deferred passes before the copy can see them,
//    so moving the snapshot beside `capture::tick` (after the last draw, where the swap pays that
//    flush anyway) should have been free. Built and measured on the dev set: **48.1 ms deferred vs
//    45.3 ms mid-frame** — no difference, so the position costs nothing and the simpler code is the
//    one to keep. The cost is elsewhere; see the measurements on [`blur_snapshot`].
// 3. **Passes are a large part of the budget.** Two exact-2x reductions, two quarter-size Kawase
//    passes and one half-size up-filter make five render passes. Region limiting cuts their
//    fragments, but it does not make a small glass ornament free. The blur radius comes mostly
//    from the downsample rather than from kernel width; `fs_blur.frag` argues the tap count.
//    **Those figures are the 1:1 television**; every size here is derived from
//    `surface::viewport()` at first use, not written down. The simulator found out why within an
//    hour of this landing: its drawable is HALF the authored canvas, and a chain hard-coded to
//    1920x1080 grabbed a rect that does not exist, then sampled a UV window that mapped to no part
//    of the screen. On a 1:1 surface both bugs are invisible — which is the whole class of thing
//    the desktop simulator is for. The chain is built once because the drawable never changes
//    after `surface::probe` (no resize on either platform); a surface that could would owe this an
//    invalidation.
// 4. **Every Midgard trap the capture chain documents applies here**, because it is the same
//    machinery: NPOT targets REQUIRE CLAMP_TO_EDGE + LINEAR (core ES2 samples them opaque black
//    under the defaults, with no GL error), `glClear` before each pass spares the tile
//    preserve-load, and RGBA FBO renderability is implementation-defined so completeness is
//    checked and the feature LATCHES OFF rather than crashing. A latched-off blur draws nothing at
//    all and the panel keeps its own opaque ground — the fallback is the old look, not a hole.
//
// Deliberately NOT used by the player's panels (track/chapters/info/overflow). There the frame
// behind the popover is mostly alpha-0 punch-through to the hardware video plane, which GL cannot
// read: blurring it would smear transparency, not video. `docs/` and the player HUD's own notes
// say why that plane is unreachable; nothing here changes it.

/// How many exact halvings the CAPTURE path takes before the blur taps — and it is not a knob. It
/// is [`BLUR_DIRECT_SCALE`] written as a count of halvings, asserted below.
///
/// **One material, two paths.** The direct path renders the page at 1/4; the capture path has to
/// arrive at the same place. They publish into one snapshot and one shader samples it, and which
/// path served a given panel is not a property of that panel: a cached popover is served by the
/// capture path on an ordinary frame and by the DIRECT path the moment a dynamic owner is live on
/// the page under it (`/tmp/plxnative-glassboth` is the same thing on demand). So the source scale
/// belongs to the material, not to a path — a surface whose blur depends on who took the snapshot
/// is not a material at all.
///
/// **They drifted, and closing that is what this constant is for.** It went 2 -> 1 the day after the
/// direct path became the shipping one, in a commit whose subject and every measurement was the tab
/// BAR — which by then rendered its own source at 1/4 and did not read this at all. What it actually
/// changed was every CACHED popover: a half-resolution source, tap offsets that are in TEXELS and so
/// halved with it, and no up-filter at all, because the up pass was gated on `BLUR_REDUCTIONS >= 2`.
/// That is not a lighter blur. It is a 2x bilinear magnification of a half-res image with the
/// reconstruction pass switched off, and it reads as exactly what it is — measured on the
/// `checker:24` ground with the item menu over it, the pattern came through the panel as a lattice
/// of dots, and through the direct path's chain, same frame and same shader, it is gone.
///
/// Why 1/4 is the matched sampling rate for this kernel is on [`BLUR_DIRECT_SCALE`]. STRUCTURE —
/// how much of the page survives, which is the design question this constant used to carry — is
/// owned by [`BLUR_TAPS`], which both paths read at the same source scale and which sweeps without

/// TEXT and therefore the hardest thing a backdrop can be asked to pass. What the ladder showed is
/// the finding this whole material turned on: **the bar's own labels are equally legible at every

/// nothing and spending the material, and heavy blur *plus* heavy scrim is precisely how a glass
/// bar collapses into a featureless grey slab sitting on top of the page.
///
/// At 0.7/1.5 the shelf's verticals read through the interior and the cap visibly squeezes a box
/// caption into its arc; at 1.5/3.5 both are gone.

/// **Then 0.7/1.5 was narrowed again to 0.35/0.75, and the reason is that the first comparison was

/// against the macOS 26 tab bar through GlassLab, and matched it almost exactly (0.264 of a stripe
/// period against its 0.281). But this app's idiom is the TELEVISION, and the references that
/// matter are iOS and tvOS, where the material is plainly lighter: a phone number is readable
/// through the Phone app's tab bar, and a tvOS pill leaves the window mullion behind it clearly
/// visible. Those are two different materials wearing one name, and matching the desktop one is
/// matching the wrong half.
///
/// Priced at the scale that decides it — a letter stem at 1080p is a period of roughly 12–16px, so

/// settle frame erased them, which the owner saw as "discretization patterns during the
/// animation". Those screens ran at 60 fps with the noise on before the gate existed (Settings
/// root, session 4), so the gate bought nothing there. The area test below is what is left.
///
/// **And no dither on a RECT at all.** Until 2026-09-04 `fs_src` and `fs_shadow` carried the
/// prelude too, behind a per-draw ramp test (`dither_for_ramp`: slow enough, broad enough, a
/// container rather than a page field). The test answered 0 for nearly every draw — and the draws
/// still paid, because the branch it gates is resolved per draw on Midgard but not for free: the
/// hero paging scene measured +4M shader words a frame with the prelude on those two programs
/// against without, the whole of a 57→50 fps regression, on frames where every ramp test had
/// answered 0. A rect's ramp is a scrim or a two-stop fill, crossing tens of codes over hundreds
/// of pixels, and nobody had reported a tread on one; the fields that DID band (the wash, the
/// glass blur, the modal ground) are exactly the three that keep the prelude.
/// **The page wash's answer** — Home's and Detail's, the two full-screen grounds under moving,
/// fading artwork. `still` is the page's own slide/fold flag; the PAGE's motion verdict
/// (`idle::underlay_moving` — the scoped `underlay_moving` app.rs threads into every frame OR'd
/// with the unscoped `idle::page_moving`, Detail's) covers the last dozen sub-threshold frames of

// - TWO chains (parity ping-pong): the chain written this capture is never the
//   chain in flight from the last one — kills Mali's CopyTex-into-referenced-
//   texture ghosting AND lets us read a chain rendered >=1 capture-cycle (>=33ms)
//   ago, so the read degenerates to a driver memcpy instead of the 155ms
//   window-surface pipeline drain we measured.
// - Downscale is exact-2x per pass (2x bilinear == 2x2 box): 1920x1080 -> mid
//   960x540 -> out 480x270. A single 4x pass would sample only 2x2 of each 4x4
//   block -> text shimmer. Both output sizes are always allocated; the requested
//   size only selects which FBO is the pass target (no realloc on switch, no
//   size races — dims are latched per chain at write time).
// - All six textures are NPOT: CLAMP_TO_EDGE + LINEAR are REQUIRED at creation
//   (core ES2 samples an NPOT texture as opaque black under the REPEAT +
//   NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR defaults — no GL error, just black), and mipmaps are
//   illegal. GL_RGBA unsized everywhere (GL_RGBA8 is not a valid ES2 token).
// - RGBA-texture FBO renderability is implementation-defined in core ES2, so
//   completeness is checked; on failure capture latches off (logged) rather than
//   crashing. Midgard exposes OES_rgb8_rgba8 in practice.
// - Y orientation: every full-quad IPROG pass flips row order once (vs_img does
//   gl_Position.y = -ndc.y with v_cuv = a_pos), glReadPixels is bottom-up memory
//   order (NOT a flip). CopyTexSubImage leaves cap_tex bottom-up; 1 pass (960 out)
//   -> top-down (correct); 2 passes (480 out) -> bottom-up again. The per-frame
//   `flip` flag tells the encoder to walk rows in reverse. No CPU flip cost — the
//   RGBA->RGB strip touches every row anyway.
// Main-thread only (like all gfx state).
