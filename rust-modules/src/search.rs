//! search — the search screen's data layer (the store `ui/search/` draws).
//!
//! One query, fanned out across every registered source, merged into typed shelves and pumped once
//! a frame while the screen is up. The types down to [`shelves`] are what `ui/search/` draws;
//! everything below the *fetch plumbing* banner is the machine that fills them. [`terms`] is the
//! one predicate the screen shares with the store — see its doc before writing a second one.
//!
//! ## The endpoint, and what it actually returns
//!
//! `GET /hubs/search?query=…&limit=…` ([`crate::plex::Client::search`], written long before this
//! screen and dead until now). The spec says it "is intended to be very fast, and called as the
//! user types", which is the design this store is built for. Three things were measured against
//! PMS 1.43.3 rather than taken from the spec, each of which decides something here:
//!
//! - **A one-character query returns every hub empty.** So [`MIN_QUERY`] is 2, and the first
//!   keystroke of every search costs no round trip at all.
//! - **Hub ORDER moves per query** — `sta` ranks people first, `star` ranks films first. So the
//!   shelf order here is FIXED ([`KINDS`]) and ranking is honoured only *inside* a shelf.
//!   Reordering shelves per keystroke would move the row under the user's focus while they type.
//! - **Items arrive in two different containers** — see [`crate::plex::Hub::directory`]. That is
//!   why [`Item`] has two variants instead of being one struct.
//!
//! ## Multi-source
//!
//! Search is single-server: `/hubs/search` answers for the machine you asked, and
//! `docs/shared-servers.md` states that nothing aggregates server-side — the merge is the client's
//! job. So this fans out one query per [`crate::plex::server_ids`] and merges into the shelves
//! below, which is why every [`Item`] carries its own `ServerId`.
//!
//! The merge is **round robin** ([`merge`]), not source-by-source the way Home groups its shelves.
//! Home groups because a shelf there BELONGS to a source and adjacency is what says so; a search
//! shelf is genuinely mixed (`ui/search/results.rs`: the heading "cannot claim an owner — the
//! owner annotation follows FOCUS"), so concatenating would bury a friend's best match behind
//! twenty-three worse ones of ours. There is no cross-server relevance score to sort on — the only
//! ranking any server hands over is the order of its own list — so taking one from each in turn is
//! the most each server's ranking can be honoured at once.
//!
//! A source that fails contributes nothing and **fails nobody else**: each has its own in-flight
//! claim, its own retry backoff and its own mailbox, and [`State`] is `Failed` only when every one
//! of them is.
//!
//! ## The idiom to copy
//!
//! `person.rs`, not `browse.rs`: generation + a **monotone** mailbox write + [`supersede`] + a
//! per-fetch in-flight flag and retry backoff, pumped once a frame. As-you-type guarantees
//! overlapping workers, and a monotone mailbox is what stops a slow answer for `wal` repopulating
//! the results for `wallace`. Debounce is `ui/detail.rs`'s `season_settle` accumulator. Two rules
//! that are easy to miss and both wedge the screen forever if missed: release the in-flight flag
//! when `spawn_small` REFUSES, and call [`crate::ui::idle::invalidate`] on every landing including
//! the failure branch.
