//! browse — the Library screen's per-section paged catalog.
//!
//! Sibling of `pms.rs`'s hub catalog, which stays hub-only (256-cap, rebuilt wholesale by
//! `pms`'s worker-driven hub catalog); this store pages arbitrarily large sections without blocking the
//! main loop. Data model: one sparse `Vec<Option<PmsMovie>>` per section, sized to the
//! listing's `totalSize`, filled page-by-page (`PAGE` items) by ONE background fetch at a
//! time using the season-switch idiom from `metadata.rs` — [`crate::task::spawn_small`] + a
//! `Mutex` mailbox + generation atomics (a re-query supersedes in-flight landings), applied
//! on the main thread by [`pump`] once a frame while the Library screen is up.
//!
//! The sort/filter MENUS are server-driven: the first page of a section is requested with
//! `includeMeta=1` and the response's `Meta.Type[]` supplies the Sort entries; the genre
//! value list is fetched lazily (`kick_genres`) when the filter menu first opens. Nothing
//! menu-shaped is hardcoded — a music section would bring its own sorts.
//!
//! All statics are main-thread-only (same discipline as `pms.rs`); the worker threads touch
//! only the mailboxes + atomics and the `&'static` plex client.
//!
//! ## The table addresses (SOURCE, section), not a section
//!
//! A section key is only unique within one server: measured 2026-08-11 against a real share, our
//! own server's section `1` and the friend's section `1` are different libraries, and each server
//! answers 401 to the other's token. So the table is a flat `Vec<BrowseSection>` whose every entry
//! names its [`BrowseSource`], and every fetch is issued through `client_for(source.sid)` captured
//! AT THE SPAWN SITE — never `client()` read inside a worker, which would dial whichever server
//! happened to be current when the thread got scheduled.
//!
//! **It grows by APPEND and never by rebuild**, which is what keeps the page mailbox sound. A page
//! landing is blamed on a section INDEX (`PageResult.sec`), so an index that moved under an
//! in-flight fetch would splice one library's items into another's store. The old
//! the old synchronous discovery's early-return was the only thing preventing that; appending is the property
//! that replaces it, and it holds for every source that lands later rather than only for the
//! second call.
