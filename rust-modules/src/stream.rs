//! Blocking HTTP/1.1 over a raw TCP socket (was src/stream.c). Callers
//! (posters/pms/player) allocate an `HttpStream` and pass `&hs`; this operates on it
//! in place. Header/chunk parsing is bounds-checked (no OOB).
//!
//! The host is a **name or an address literal of either family**, resolved through `getaddrinfo`
//! ([`resolve`]) and dialled down the whole returned chain ([`connect_any_result`]). It used to be
//! four decimal octets parsed by hand into a `sockaddr_in`, which made a hostname and every IPv6
//! server not "degraded" but impossible — the shape of the gap LG's checklist #43 CASE2 asks about.
//! What is still missing here is TLS: this arm stays cleartext. [`crate::http`] sends an `https://`
//! control-plane origin through [`crate::net`], while MEDIA bytes use [`crate::curlio`], a
//! libcurl-multi pull source under the same `ff.rs` AVIO that this module serves for `http`.
//!
//! Failures the legacy `0`/`-1` return cannot carry are reported to the event log instead: a
//! non-2xx response (where the code is known and the socket is about to close) and a body that came
//! up short of its `Content-Length` ([`short_body_line`]). [`http_open_until_result`] additionally
//! preserves the setup failure's typed cause for deadline-aware callers. A truncated body is still
//! handed to its caller, and no line built here carries a query string, which is [`log_endpoint`]'s
//! rule and the reason it exists.

        // This was tried once and REVERTED (docs/async-model-decision.md): it made every reopen
        // interruptible while the pump was firing `http_shutdown` to service a SEEK, which cost
        // `seek_inplace_h264`. That coupling is gone — 5938b5f/71929ee moved seeking into the
        // demux thread's own `av_seek_frame`, so the only `http_shutdown` left in the tree is
        // teardown's (`player/engine.rs`), where cutting an open short is precisely the intent.
        //
        // Worth publishing this early only because `shutdown(2)` aborts a handshake in progress on
        // the TV's kernel — measured with `tools/sockprobe.c`, NOT assumed. Linux is documented to
        // fail this with ENOTCONN and the host (Darwin) does something different again, so the
        // question could not be settled by reading or by `cargo test`. If that ever stops holding,
        // publishing after `connect_timeout` still buys the 15 s `SO_RCVTIMEO` window, which is
        // the bulk of the win.
        //
        // Also the path a teardown takes: `http_shutdown` aborts the handshake, and `connect_any`
        // reports the failure one poll later — and, seeing the interrupt latch, stops walking
        // rather than answering the teardown with the next address.
        //
        // The latch is read on BOTH sides of the walk, which is what makes "a shutdown anywhere in

// a refused connection produces, and `http_put` returned the status with the body dropped. That
// collapse is precisely what `plex::probe::Outcome` exists to prevent — a final `401` after the
// direct/relay candidates settle is a TOKEN or access-policy problem, while a refusal is a
// REACHABILITY one, and reporting the first as the second sends a user to their friend's router.
// `auth::get_identity` had already had to hand-roll its own open/read/close for that reason.
//
// Their replacement is `crate::http`, the one door that dispatches a control-plane request on its
// origin's SCHEME — this module for plaintext, `net.rs`/libcurl for TLS — and returns the status
// AND the body over either. Its plaintext arm is the same composition the wrappers were, so
// nothing about the bytes on the wire moved; `note_short_body` above went `pub(crate)` to keep the
// short-body notice on that path.
