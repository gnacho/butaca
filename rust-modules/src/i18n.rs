//! i18n - the runtime translation layer (issue #1).
//!
//! One language is compiled in as the SOURCE: English, in the literals at every draw site. That
//! literal is also the KEY - gettext's shape - which is what makes the fallback free: a key with
//! no entry IS its own English rendering, so a missing translation degrades to today's app
//! rather than to an empty label. The Spanish table lives below as one compile-time `match`,
//! per the issue's own constraint: no allocation, no file reads, `&'static str` out for a
//! `&'static str` in, fitting the drawing style the UI is written in.
//!
//! **The language follows the television.** webOS writes the set's own display locale to
//! `/var/luna/preferences/localeInfo` (`{"localeInfo":{"locales":{"UI":"es-ES",…}},…}` - read
//! off a real 5.5 set), and the `UI` field is the one that means "what language the menus are
//! in". Detection runs once at boot, before the first frame, so no label is ever drawn in one
//! language and re-drawn in another; there is deliberately NO in-app override in this first
//! cut, because the issue scoped selection to the system locale and a settings toggle that can
//! disagree with the television is a second state to get wrong. On the simulator and host the
//! file does not exist and the answer is English - the honest reading of a machine with no
//! locale at all.
//!
//! **What is deliberately not translated:** the legal, privacy and consent documents
//! (`consent.rs`, the legal overlays). Their wording makes checkable claims that tests pin, and
//! a translation of a claim is a second claim nobody graded - the issue names this decision as
//! explicit, and this is it. Server data (titles, biographies, roles) is the server's language,
//! never ours to translate.
