//! The Library browse screen — a full-section poster wall with server-driven sort/filter.
//!
//! Layout (per the approved mock): the shared top bar (profile chip leading at the margin +
//! CENTERED tab pills Home | Movies | TV Shows | Search, the tvOS tab-bar idiom — [`draw_tab_row`] is shared
//! with Home), a toolbar of two menu chips (Sort · X / Filter · X, the latter naming every active filter) + item
//! count), and a 6-across vertical grid of [`card_row`] leaf tiles fed by the `browse` paged
//! store. Menus are Popover + TableView (the track-menu components), their contents entirely
//! server-driven (`browse::sorts()` from `includeMeta=1`; genres from the value list).
//!
//! Focus model: three bands — Tabs, Toolbar, Grid — plus a modal menu state. BACK walks
//! grid/toolbar → tab bar → (app.rs) Home: the Netflix-2025 escape rule, so the nav is always
//! one press away at any scroll depth. Focus/scroll per section persist in the browse store.
//!
//! Reload choreography: every path that REPLACES the item set (tab, sort, unwatched, genre, and a
//! profile switch wiping the store from underneath) is deferred through [`Xfade`] — fade the
//! outgoing wall out, swap at the floor, fade the new one in — because `browse::requery` empties
//! the store synchronously on the key press, so there is nothing left to fade unless the animation
//! SCHEDULES the swap. The queued action is the typed [`Pending`]; the top chrome reads it through
//! the `view_*` resolvers so a chip relabels on the press frame while the grid is still dissolving.
//!
//! Perf discipline (32-bit A53 + Mali): the grid steps TWO scale springs total (focused +
//! shrinking previous), culls rows with `on_axis`, and only visible cells call `resolve_tex`
//! (the 64-slot poster LRU must never see off-screen requests).

//     ("Shared by <handle> · your own server is fine."). This is the one place outside the Sources
//     list that speaks a machine name, because the machine is what failed; and the reason does two
//     jobs at once — whose it is, and that nothing else is down.
//   * Those are the only two identifying strings this screen renders, and the list is CLOSED. No
//     address, no path, no URL, no machineIdentifier, no token — `ui::stats`' redaction rule, and
//     for its reason: a read-out is something a user PHOTOGRAPHS for a bug report, and on a
//     borrowed source the machine is not even theirs to publish.
