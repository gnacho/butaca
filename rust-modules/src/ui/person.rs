//! The person / actor page — reached by pressing OK on a detail page's cast headshot.
//!
//! **The reference is `Person Screen v2.dc.html`** (the owner's design project), whose shape is
//! Apple TV's, not Plex's field list. One scroll flow, two states of one header:
//!
//! * an **asymmetric editorial band** across the top — a circular portrait on the left with a text
//!   column beside it (name at HERO, a roles kicker, a Born/Died line, a 3-line bio that dissolves
//!   into a right-pinned `MORE`), the two **centred on each other** — followed by plain **`Movies`
//!   / `Shows` shelves** of ordinary poster cards on the shared [`CardRow`] strip, each heading
//!   carrying its count.
//! * the band **CONDENSES once focus drops into the shelves** (portrait 320→160, the name steps
//!   HERO→TITLE, every other header line fades out) and expands again when focus returns. The
//!   condense is editorial, not load-bearing: v2's side-by-side packing already fits the first
//!   shelf under the EXPANDED band (v1's stacked column did not — that is why the header became a
//!   focus row in the first place), so shrinking it is about handing the room to the content the
//!   user is now looking at, exactly as the mockup stages it.
//!
//! **The band centres its two halves rather than top-aligning them** (owner call 2026-07-30, over
//! the mock's `align-items: flex-start` and its `padding-top: 14px`). That pad was a CSS artifact
//! anyway — a 72px line box carries leading above its caps, which our cap-band placement does not
//! have (`ui::label`'s layout ≠ paint rule) — but the alignment itself is the deliberate change:
//! against a 3-line bio, a top-aligned circle reads as floating beside a ragged column.
//!
//! Two rendering notes on the condense. The name cannot animate its POINT SIZE — every
//! intermediate size would rasterize a fresh glyph run into the cache — so it is drawn as a
//! crossfade between its two rung sizes while the geometry (portrait diameter, column x) rides
//! the one `cond` spring. And the whole page sits on an **ambient wash** ([`Painter::ambient`])
//! that is keyed to the focused poster's `UltraBlurColors` — the same corner data home's backdrop
//! and detail's below-hero wash draw — fading to a faint warm `ACCENT` tint while the header holds
//! focus; twelve small springs chase the corner channels so a focus change is a dissolve, not a cut.
//!
//! **Every header line below the name is optional, and the block reads as finished without them.**
//! The name + portrait arrive with the page (the cast row already held them); the roles/dates/bio
//! come from plex.tv (`crate::person`, `plex/discover.rs`) and may never come at all. Each line is
//! drawn only when it has content and the measured flow centres what is present, so the degenerate
//! page — portrait, name, shelves — is composed, not broken. No placeholder, no header spinner.
//!
//! Structure mirrors `detail.rs`: the page is a [`ScrollColumn`] whose children are **the header**
//! and the PRESENT shelves. The header is still a **focus row** (child 0): reachability no longer
//! forces it (see above), but it is what UP from the first shelf lands on, it is the page's top
//! scroll position, and it is the state the condense keys off. Perf discipline for the A53 + Mali:
//! shelves draw through [`card_row::strip`] (`on_axis`-culled, so only VISIBLE tiles touch
//! `resolve_tex`), the header flow is measured once per store change (never per frame), and
//! `crate::person` caps each shelf at a `CardRow`'s spring count.
