//! In-player modal track menu: audio + subtitle pickers over the video, rendered on the reusable
//! animated `TableView` (Apple-TV "settings" look — a sliding pill selection, section header with
//! a codec accessory, per-row badges, a leading checkmark on the active track). app.rs routes
//! D-pad/OK/BACK here while the menu is open; LEFT/RIGHT switch between the Audio and Subtitles
//! panels. The selection commit (native audio switch / server transcode / burn) is unchanged
//! from the previous procedural version — only the presentation moved onto the table.
//!
//! **The Subtitles panel is grouped, not one flat list** (plan `subtitle-menu-capsule` §3,
//! `/tmp/dsplayer/player.html:1104-1162`): Off and every single-track "yours" language sit under
//! one "Subtitles" header; a "yours" language with several tracks gets its own section (header =
//! language, `accessory("N tracks")`), ranked full < SDH < forced < commentary; a headerless
//! section holds Timing and Color; and everything else falls under "Other languages". That
//! grouping is a pure DATA model, `metadata::sub_layout` (host-tested without a
//! `PlaybackSession`/`MetadataView` fixture); this module only turns it into `TableView` sections
//! ([`table_sections`]) and answers focus/OK over the flat [`RowTarget`] vec it yields. "Yours" is
//! the pref language (if the play resolved under one), the playing audio's language, and the
//! current subtitle's own language, in that order (`route::cur_sub_pref_lang`, carried in by
//! `screens::player::overlay`).
//!
//! **Timing** is a single row that reads out the current offset; OK on it does not step anything
//! here — it returns [`TrackOk::OpenTiming`], which `screens::player::overlay`'s `activate` turns
//! into a hand-off: it dismisses this panel and presents the Timing capsule overlay
//! (`OverlayKind::Timing`, `ui::timing_capsule`) in its place. The row is dim and inert while
//! subtitles are Off (OK there neither opens the capsule nor closes the panel), and the whole
//! section is omitted during a transcode, which burns captions into the picture where no
//! client-side offset can reach.
//!
//! **Color** is a single cycling row: OK steps `SubtitleTone::LADDER` with wrap and keeps the
//! panel open ([`TrackOk::Commit`]'s `keep_open`), so a run of presses is felt immediately — and
//! re-writes that one row's read-out in place rather than rebuilding the list.
