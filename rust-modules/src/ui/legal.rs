const PRIVACY: &str = "RESPONSIBLE FOR BUTACA DATA\n\nbutaca’s maintainers are responsible only for data butaca stores locally and for optional reports you choose to share.\n\nYOUR JELLYFIN SERVER\n\nbutaca is an independent client for Jellyfin. There is no central Jellyfin account service: to sign you in, browse and play media, update watch progress and use server features, the app communicates directly with the Jellyfin server you name. Those requests are handled by that server and its operator. butaca’s developer does not receive them.\n\nON THIS TELEVISION\n\nbutaca stores the address of your Jellyfin server, your username and your password (in a file only the app can read), a device identifier, your Home library choices, your recent searches, your playback quality preference, and a small rotating local log. It also stores your answers to the two optional-reporting questions, the random Analytics ID if you turned product analytics on, any report waiting to be sent, and a marker recording how much of the crash log has already been read. It keeps no bookmark of its own for where you stopped watching: playback position is held by your Jellyfin server. Delete all local data in Settings signs out and removes butaca data from this television.\n\nOPTIONAL CRASH REPORTS\n\nIf enabled, technical crash details are sent to Sentry in Germany. They can include the signal, code addresses, thread information and device compatibility details. A crash report carries no installation identifier, so it cannot be linked to you or to any other report you have sent.\n\nOPTIONAL PRODUCT ANALYTICS\n\nIf enabled, screen and feature events and broad sign-in and playback outcomes are sent to PostHog in Germany with a random installation identifier. Settings shows that identifier as your Analytics ID while product analytics is on.\n\nNEVER INCLUDED\n\nTitles, Jellyfin account names, searches, server names or addresses, passwords and tokens, subtitle text and exact viewing history are not included in either optional report type. Both choices are independent and can be changed at any time in Settings.\n\nRETENTION\n\nDifferent things here have different lifetimes, so this is stated for each. Your sign-in — the stored server address, username and password — is removed when you sign out. Your answers to the two optional-reporting questions, and the Analytics ID if one exists, are kept apart from the sign-in and are NOT removed by signing out: they are meant to outlast it, so that a decision you have already made is not put to you again. A report waiting to be sent is deleted once it is sent, and a queued report of a category you switch off is deleted at that moment. The local log rotates, so its oldest lines are discarded continuously. Delete all local data removes all of it. A report that has already been sent is held by the service that received it, under that service’s own retention schedule; write to the contact below to ask what those periods currently are.\n\nYOUR CHOICES AND HOW TO ASK\n\nBoth optional reports are off until you turn them on, and either can be turned off again at any time in Settings. Delete all local data removes what butaca stored on this television; it does not reach anything already sent. To ask what product analytics holds for your installation, or to have it deleted, write to the contact below and quote your Analytics ID from Settings. Crash reports carry no installation identifier, so an individual crash report cannot be found or deleted on request; those age out under the retention schedule above.\n\nWHERE DATA IS PROCESSED\n\nOptional crash reports are processed by Sentry in Germany and optional product analytics by PostHog in Germany. A Jellyfin server you connect to may be located anywhere and is operated by whoever runs it, not by butaca’s developer.\n\nUNINSTALLING\n\nRemoving butaca removes the application, but webOS gives an application no way to run code as it is removed, so anything kept outside the application’s own directory can survive. Two things are deliberately kept there: your sign-in, so that reinstalling does not sign you out, and your optional-reporting answers together with the Analytics ID, so that a decision you have already made is not put to you again after a reinstall. Use Delete all local data BEFORE uninstalling if you want nothing of butaca left on this television.\n\nCONTACT\n\nPrivacy questions: support@plxnative.com";

    ///   position is read from and reported to the server. **Do not cite `coldstart.rs` as the
    ///   evidence** — what it retired is `lastplace.json`, the last-PAGE/route bookmark (which
    ///   Detail or Library screen a cold boot reopened), which is a different artefact that was
    ///   conflated with a playhead when this test was written.
    /// * `session.rs` persists `recent_searches` — the exact search terms, per Home profile — plus
    ///   per-server tokens and server addresses. None were listed.
    /// * `install_id` is minted for PostHog only (`telemetry/sender.rs`); the Sentry arm never
    ///   attaches it. A policy that offers deletion of "your reports" without that distinction
    ///   promises something crash reports cannot deliver.
    /// * The sign-in is stored OUTSIDE the app directory on purpose (`paths.rs`), so it survives a
    ///   reinstall. "Uninstall removes everything" would have been false.
