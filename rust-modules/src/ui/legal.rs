const PRIVACY: &str = "RESPONSIBLE FOR PLXNATIVE DATA\n\nGleb Linnik is responsible only for data PlxNative stores locally and for optional reports you choose to share.\n\nPLEX SERVICES\n\nPlxNative is an independent client for Plex. To sign you in, discover servers and provide Plex account features, the app communicates directly with Plex services. Plex processes information received by those services under Plex’s own Privacy Policy. PlxNative’s developer does not receive that information.\n\nPlex Privacy Policy: https://www.plex.tv/about/privacy-legal/\n\nPLEX MEDIA SERVERS\n\nTo browse and play media, update watch progress and use server features, PlxNative communicates directly with the Plex Media Servers you select. Those requests are handled by the selected server and its operator. PlxNative’s developer does not receive them.\n\nON THIS TELEVISION\n\nPlxNative stores your Plex account token and a separate token for each server you use, the addresses and identifiers of those servers, the profile you selected together with the profile names and pictures on your account, your Home library choices, your recent searches, your playback quality preference, and a small rotating local log. It also stores your answers to the two optional-reporting questions, the random Crash report ID if you turned crash reports on, the random Analytics ID if you turned product analytics on, any report waiting to be sent, and a marker recording how much of the crash log has already been read. It keeps no bookmark of its own for where you stopped watching: playback position is held by your Plex Media Server. Delete all local data in Settings signs out and removes PlxNative data from this television.\n\nYour sign-in is protected with this television's own key service when one is available and this install has shown it can be trusted: the app checks, on a later launch, that the television's key service can still open something it sealed before, and only after that check has passed does it seal your actual sign-in with it — until then the sign-in is kept in an owner-only file that only PlxNative can read. Two small, content-only markers on disk record the outcome of that check: `secure-storage.proven` records that the key service has been shown to work on this install, `secure-storage.refused` that it has been shown not to. Neither carries key material. If the saved sign-in file is ever found writable by other apps on this television, its contents are not trusted or used: it is set aside unread as `<id>-auth.json.untrusted` beside itself, still readable only by PlxNative, and signing out or Delete all local data removes it.\n\nOPTIONAL CRASH REPORTS\n\nIf enabled, technical crash details are sent to Sentry in Germany. They can include the signal, code addresses, thread information and device compatibility details. Each report carries a random Crash report ID created on this television when you turned crash reports on, so that repeated crashes under one Crash report ID are counted once rather than once each. It is not derived from your Plex account, your television or anything about you, and it is never sent with product analytics. Settings shows it as your Crash report ID while crash reports are on. The same choice also covers a handled sign-in error report when a sign-in attempt fails: which stage failed, a coarse class of what plex.tv's last answer actually was, that exact HTTP status or curl return code as a bare number, bucketed counts and durations, and how your sign-in is stored on this television right now. It contains no PIN, sign-in code, token, account, URL, hostname or address. The same choice also covers a handled storage error report when this television's attempt to seal or open your saved sign-in fails, or the file itself cannot be written at all: which step failed, the numeric error code the key service replied with, how the session is protected right now, and whether this install has already recorded its key service as refused. When it is known, it also says whether the device key that attempt used already existed or was newly created, and always says how that attempt identified itself to the key service, as two Yes/No facts: whether it used an application identity, and whether it instead used a fixed name on the system bus — never both, and No to both on a television whose system bus grants neither. Separately, it says which identity protected the saved sign-in the report is about, as one of app_id, named, anonymous, or none where the report is about nothing protected at all. It contains no key material, ciphertext, plaintext or file path. The same storage error report can also carry a compact candidate-location summary of which of this television's candidate sign-in locations were checked and how each one went. It also covers a fresh sign-in whose file could not be kept the way this television decided to keep it: what the save actually did and, when it left an existing file alone rather than overwriting it, why; it may carry the same save-outcome and candidate-location facts — each outcome one closed word, including one that says only that the file was there and its contents were not recognised at all — built only from closed words and small numbers and never a file path. It is sent only once you have answered the crash-reports question Yes; a report found before that question is answered waits in memory, dated to when it actually happened, for the rest of that one launch only, and is discarded if you answer No or if the app closes before you answer. Separately, whether or not crash reporting is on, you can request a diagnostic report from Details on the sign-in screen. The screen can also offer a one-off report about a specific sign-in problem. Opening Details sends nothing: you must confirm Send report. Working QR polling is not labelled as a connection failure merely because you requested diagnostics. The report distinguishes the original startup read from a later fresh sign-in save: candidate categories and rejection reasons; credential-presence and local-boot booleans; key-service stages and numeric errors; registration and sealed-key identity categories; save outcomes and disk readback; and per-candidate write operations, numeric OS errors, policy rejections and directory-sync durability warnings. It also includes app/webOS versions and hardware-class information, never file contents, paths, account names, credentials, PINs, sign-in codes or network addresses. It carries no identifier that persists between reports or identifies you or this television — not the Crash report ID, not the Analytics ID. A random one-off Report ID identifies only that event and is shown in Details so you can quote it. Sending it does not enable either optional reporting category or store an account-wide consent decision. Reports normally queue on disk for background delivery. If the queue cannot be written, one bounded background send is attempted directly from memory. Queued does not mean received; a direct request is marked sent only after a successful server response. If it fails, you can retry explicitly. An in-memory request cannot survive closing the app.\n\nOPTIONAL PRODUCT ANALYTICS\n\nIf enabled, screen and feature events and broad sign-in and playback outcomes are sent to PostHog in Germany with a random Analytics ID created when you turned product analytics on, and every event carries how the saved sign-in is stored on this television. Settings shows that identifier as your Analytics ID while product analytics is on.\n\nNEVER INCLUDED\n\nTitles, Plex accounts, searches, server names or addresses, tokens, subtitle text, key material, ciphertext, plaintext, file paths, and exact viewing history are not included in either optional report type. Both choices are independent and can be changed at any time in Settings.\n\nRETENTION\n\nDifferent things here have different lifetimes, so this is stated for each. Your sign-in, the servers registered with it and their tokens are removed when you sign out. Your answers to the two optional-reporting questions, and the Crash report ID and Analytics ID if they exist, belong to that sign-in: signing out removes them with it, and whoever signs in next is asked afresh. Switching between the profiles of one Plex account is not a sign-out and keeps them. A report waiting to be sent is deleted once it is sent. Switching a category off deletes that category's own queued reports; one report the sender had already picked up at that moment may still be sent, and no further report of that category is picked up after it. Signing out, or Delete all local data, is a harder stop: it destroys everything queued at once, including one-off reports. Signing out or deleting local data also clears pending in-memory report state; neither action can retract a request already transmitted. The local log rotates, so its oldest lines are discarded continuously. Delete all local data removes all of it. A report that has already been sent is held by the service that received it, under that service’s own retention schedule; write to the contact below to ask what those periods currently are.\n\nYOUR CHOICES AND HOW TO ASK\n\nBoth optional reports are off until you turn them on, and either can be turned off again at any time in Settings. When this notice changes, whether you are asked again depends on what changed: a wording-only revision describing the same data and the same purpose is never a new question; a new field that still fits the data and purpose you already read about is checked against the answer you already gave rather than opening one; a wider purpose, or data materially different from what you were told, is a new question for that change alone, asked before PlxNative starts collecting it, and it names only the category that actually grew. Declining an expansion is not the same as switching a category off: it keeps what you already agreed to running exactly as it was, sends nothing of the new part, and does not ask again until it grows further still — turning a category off entirely stays a separate action, any time, in Settings. The record of what you accepted, and what you last declined, is kept, so a later expansion is checked against the real answer you gave, not a guess. Delete all local data removes what PlxNative stored on this television; it does not reach anything already sent. To ask what crash reports or product analytics hold for your installation, or to have them deleted, write to the contact below and quote your Crash report ID or Analytics ID from Settings. For a particular one-off report, quote the one-off Report ID shown in Details. That random event identifier does not link separate reports to you or your television. Turning a category off deletes its identifier from this television, and so does signing out; reports already sent keep the old one, so copy it down first if you intend to ask for their deletion.\n\nWHERE DATA IS PROCESSED\n\nOptional crash reports are processed by Sentry in Germany and optional product analytics by PostHog in Germany. Plex processes what its own services receive under Plex’s Privacy Policy. A Plex Media Server you connect to may be located anywhere and is operated by whoever runs it, not by PlxNative’s developer.\n\nUNINSTALLING\n\nRemoving PlxNative removes the application, but webOS gives an application no way to run code as it is removed, so anything kept outside the application’s own directory can survive. Two things are deliberately kept there: your sign-in, so that reinstalling does not sign you out, and — because they belong to that sign-in — your optional-reporting answers together with the Crash report ID and Analytics ID, so that a decision you have already made is not put to you again after a reinstall. Use Delete all local data BEFORE uninstalling if you want nothing of PlxNative left on this television.\n\nCONTACT\n\nPrivacy questions: support@plxnative.com";
