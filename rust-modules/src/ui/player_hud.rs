//   * chapter-boundary ticks — the rail reads cleaner as one continuous bar. The chapter LIST is
//     the affordance (`ui/chapters_panel.rs`, off `metadata::playing_chapters()`).
//   * intro/credits segment bands — removed 2026-08-04. They were `RAIL_MARKER`, white at 0.42
//     against a 0.20 track, so a credits band on a feature film was a bright unlabelled patch
//     floating near the right end of an otherwise empty rail. Reviewed cold on a screenshot it
//     read as a RENDERING ARTIFACT, not as information, which is a complete failure of the thing.
//
// Neither loses anything: the Skip Intro / Skip Credits pill (`ui/skip_pill.rs`) is driven from
// the very same `metadata::playing_markers()` and appears exactly when a marker is reachable, so
// the band was decoration duplicating a control that already announces itself. Do not re-add
// either as a "cheap win" — the marker data is already in memory, which is precisely what makes
// drawing it tempting and still wrong.
