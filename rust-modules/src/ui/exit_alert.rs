//! **The exit alert** — the app's ONE decision alert, and the only place PlxNative asks a question
//! before doing something the user cannot take back.
//!
//! BACK at Home's root used to quit outright. That is the correct *destination* — Home is the root
//! and there is nowhere further back to go — but it is a one-press exit from a screen the user
//! reaches by pressing BACK a few times too many, and on a television the remote's BACK is the key
//! people lean on. So the press now raises this, and only *Exit* sets `running = false`.
//!
//! **It is a `Popover`, not a `Route`.** Every other modal that owns the whole frame is a route
//! because it can stand on more than one page (`Account { over }`, `ItemMenu { over }`) or because
//! it lives inside the player's `Overlay`. This one has exactly one host, forever: Home's root. A
//! `Route` arm for it would add a variant to `route_wears_tab_bar`, `page_of`, `Nav` and
//! `node_route` that could only ever answer "Home", i.e. four more places to keep a constant
//! true. What it DOES take from the route family is the modal discipline — `app.rs` gives it the
//! first arm of both the key ladder and the pointer chain, so while it is up nothing behind it can
//! be driven. A control that is not drawn must not be activatable, and a page under an alert is
//! not being drawn *for the user* even though its pixels are still on the panel.
//!
//! The scrim belongs to the PAGE (`Popover::scrim` + `content_painter`) — `app.rs` calls
//! [`draw_scrim`] at the end of its page closure, so the dim reaches the blur source and the panel's
//! frosted ground is not brighter than the screen it sits in. There is no [`Opener`] to lift: this
//! alert is about the app, not about an element on the page, and lifting a card out of the dim
//! would point it at something it is not talking about.
//!
//! [`Opener`]: crate::ui::popover::Opener
