//! Reusable two-choice decision alert.  It owns focus, hit geometry and destructive styling; a
//! caller supplies the question, the two verbs and — for a question whose consequences its verb
//! does not state — an optional body, which this module measures and which grows the panel.
//!
//! [`layout`] is the pure half, `layout(question_h, body_h)`, and `body_h == 0.0` is byte-identical
//! to the geometry that existed before bodies did (`no_body_leaves_the_geometry_untouched`), which
//! is the shape an alert takes when it asks its question and nothing more. No shipping alert does
//! that today — the last bare one was `ui::exit_alert`, retired 2026-09-03 when BACK at a root
//! stopped asking anything and started handing the screen back to the television, and the one that
//! ships (Privacy & data's *Delete local data*) carries a body — so that test is now the ONLY thing
//! holding the body-free arithmetic, and it is kept deliberately: the next question this app asks
//! will almost certainly be a bare one. The body is held on the ALERT
//! rather than passed to [`DecisionAlert::draw`] because it moves the controls, and
//! [`DecisionAlert::press_at`] has to compute the same panel the last draw did.
//!
//! **Every interactive exit — confirm, cancel, or BACK — takes [`DecisionAlert::dismiss`], never
//! [`DecisionAlert::close`].** `close` is [`Popover::close`]'s case: a subject that vanished out
//! from under the alert, or a defensive reset before opening it fresh (`consent`'s `open`/
//! `open_settings` both call it for exactly that, unconditionally, before the alert has ever shown
//! anyone anything). A person's OWN answer is not that case, however destructive: the alert has
//! already been seen and already been answered, and the caller learns the choice from
//! [`DecisionAlert::choice`] before anything the answer authorizes runs — so there is always a
//! frame in which fading it out costs nothing but a few frames of a panel already leaving. Reported
//! off `consent.rs`'s "Delete all local data" flow (2026-09-03): confirming jumped straight to an
//! instant hide because the confirm arm reused the screen's own defensive `close()` reset instead
//! of `dismiss()` — this alert had the same appearance animation `exit_alert` shares, and none
//! leaving. A
//! caller that tears its OWN host down synchronously under the alert (as that same confirm arm
//! still does, to the Settings screen behind it) may keep doing so; the alert's fade then simply
//! runs over whatever the app shows next, exactly like a dismissed `account_menu`/`item_menu`
//! fading over the host it returned to.
