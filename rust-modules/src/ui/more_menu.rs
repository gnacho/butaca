//! The player transport's **overflow menu** — the popover behind the third control disc (`…`), on
//! the same animated [`TableView`] as the subtitle/audio and profile menus. It only REPORTS the
//! chosen [`Action`]; `app.rs` performs it, exactly as the profile menu did before it became
//! an owned surface ([`crate::screens::account_menu`], restructure phase 10).
//!
//! # Why an overflow menu exists at all
//!
//! **Stats for nerds**, the diagnostics overlay ([`crate::app::diagnostics`]), needs a home a stranger can
//! find, because it is how this app gets bug reports off televisions nobody here owns — every other
//! diagnostic surface in the codebase (the `/tmp/plxnative-*` triggers, the remote FIFO, the
//! capture stream) is compiled out of RELEASE builds by the `devtriggers` feature, which is what a
//! user installs. "Press `…`, turn Stats for nerds on, photograph the screen" is a sentence that
//! fits in a GitHub reply and needs no ssh, no root and no rebuild.
//!
//! It held that one row for a while, and a menu with one row is not a mistake either: the
//! alternative — hanging the toggle off a hidden key chord — is undiscoverable by exactly the
//! people who would report the bug, and the alternative to THAT is a fourth disc for a control most
//! users touch once. Overflow is what a `…` means.
//!
//! # Two sections, and the two row idioms they are each drawn in
//!
//! **Quality leads.** It is the primary playback control this popover exists to reach — a rung
//! picked here re-routes the picture that is on screen right now (see below). **Options** trails
//! it: the diagnostics switch is an overflow affordance, something a viewer reaches for once, to
//! photograph a bug, not a control anyone returns to.
//!
//! **Quality** is the [`crate::route::Quality`] ladder — Original, fixed rungs, and Auto once its
//! playback readiness gate opens — and its rows carry
//! [`Row::checked`]'s LEADING checkmark, which means "the active one of several". That is the same
//! design-system rule from the other side: **a mark says where you are and a word says what is set,
//! and no row says both**, which is why a rung's rate rides inside its own label rather than in a
//! trailing value beside the mark. (The Options row drew as a PAIR OF MARKS for one day, a ring
//! ticked when on; those assets were deleted the same evening — see [`crate::ui::icons`].)
//!
//! **Options** holds switches. Its row carries [`Row::toggle`], so it states itself as the WORD
//! `On`/`Off` at the row's trailing edge. It is a STATE, not a destination: a chevron would promise
//! a page behind the row and there is none.
//!
//! A flat popover with a header per section, deliberately, rather than a Quality row that drills
//! into a second page: `docs/parity-gaps.md`'s standing decision is that this app has **no
//! full-screen menu sheets** — the reference clients put playback quality in one and we do not —
//! and a drill-in inside a popover would need a BACK that means "up one page" where every other
//! panel's BACK means "dismiss". Six rungs and a switch fit; when they stop fitting, the
//! [`TableView`] scrolls, which is what it is for.
//!
//! The menu closes on commit either way, so the read-out is never what confirms the press: the
//! overlay appearing behind the dismissed panel — or, for a rung, the next play routing differently
//! — is.
//!
//! # What a picked rung does, and what it deliberately does not
//!
//! It is a ROUTING policy, not a number handed to the transcoder: over-ceiling content loses direct
//! play *and* the container remux, which is the only way a cap can bind at all. Original preserves
//! the source unchanged. Auto is exposed only through `route::auto_quality_ready()`, the named
//! fail-closed gate owned by the integrated HLS prime/swap path. The whole argument is
//! [`crate::route::Quality`]'s doc.
//!
//! It binds every future play, **and it re-decides the one on screen** — because this menu is the
//! ladder's only entry point, so a rung that waited for the next play would be a control that
//! visibly does nothing everywhere it can be reached. `route::set_quality` re-asks the routing
//! question with the new rung and reloads only when the answer changed; picking a HIGHER rung than
//! the picture already satisfies does nothing at all. That is a user-initiated switch and not an
//! adaptive one — nothing measures a link or moves a rung on its own.
