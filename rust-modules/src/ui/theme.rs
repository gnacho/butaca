//! `theme` — the single palette for the whole UI, in TWO LAYERS.
//!
//! **Primitives** (private, at the top of this file) are the palette itself: the only place a colour
//! CODE is written down. **Roles** (`pub`, everything after them) are the JOBS — [`TEXT_PRIMARY`],
//! [`ACCENT`], [`HAIRLINE`] — and every role resolves to a primitive, never to a fresh literal. A
//! screen may only ever name a role; that is the other end of `ui/CLAUDE.md`'s "never write a raw
//! colour literal" rule. The design project mirrors this split exactly (`tokens/primitives.css` +
//! `tokens/colors.css`), so a palette decision is one edit here and one there.
//!
//! Two roles may resolve to the SAME primitive and still stay two roles — [`ACCENT`] and
//! [`TEXT_PRIMARY`] are both `COOL_0`, [`TEXT_TERTIARY`] and [`RATING_MUTED`] both `COOL_400` —
//! because sharing a value is not sharing a job: retuning the focus fill must not restyle every
//! title on the screen. They are values on one stop for that reason, not `pub use` aliases of each
//! other.
//!
//! The values began as the player screen's literals promoted to canonical (it was the one screen
//! with a coherent design language); the two *lossy* collapses (several near-whites → `COOL_0`;
//! several dim greys → [`TEXT_SECONDARY`]/[`TEXT_TERTIARY`]) are deliberate and only visible
//! on-device — see `docs/ui-system-migration.md` §A. Colors are `[f32; 4]` (r,g,b,a); scrims supply
//! their alpha per call via [`scrim`]/[`scrim_black`].
//!
//! `ACCENT`/`ACCENT_INK` live here and are re-exported from `ui` (`mod.rs`) so the existing
//! `crate::ui::ACCENT` call sites keep compiling unchanged.

// before it was snapped. So write the code and let `rgb8` do the division; never a decimal guess.

/// MENU directly above it almost nothing is. A menu is a surface you read and act on and earns its
/// opacity; a bar is chrome you look past.

// chrome goes light and flips its ink — but it is a DISCRETE second state, and a discrete state has
// to be decided every time the ground moves. Deciding it produced four reported bugs in one week: a
// bar flipping back and forth on one unchanging hero, the same hero settling dark in one run and
// light in the next, 1.6 s between the press and the material changing on a route change, and a
// visible wrong-direction excursion while the decision was pending. Guarding it took a hysteresis
// band, a commit window, a two-independent-readings rule, an override that woke the whole screen so
// those readings could happen at all, a page-swap fast path and a frozen draw weight.
//
// A judging panel priced that against what the second polarity actually bought, on synthetic grounds
// (`ui::testpat`) rather than on whatever poster happened to be up, and three of four lenses said
// delete it. The measurements that decided it:
//
//   * with a brighter idle ink (`TEXT_READING` rather than `TEXT_TERTIARY`) the dark material sits
//     at or near its floor for every ground up to L* 73, so the light one is not rescuing the common
//     case — the two are BIT-IDENTICAL on 8 of 14 graded grounds;
//   * on the real heroes it differs on, the light material wins only where the hero is uniformly
//     bright, and wins there BY DISSOLVING: L* 97.4 against a L* 95.7 ground is 1.7 L* of
//     separation, i.e. four words and a rim with no container under them;
//   * on a hero whose ground is MIXED — half a dark building, half bright sky, which a census of a
//     real library's rotation found is the median case, span 26.8 L* — the light material lands
//     34.9 L* off the local ground on the dark half where the dark material lands 3.4 off. The
//     Apple property it was imitating (sit close to your backdrop) is honoured by the material that
//     replaced it.
//
// What remains is one black pair, solved per frame, and an ink bright enough that it rarely has to
// ask for much. `docs/glass-hardware-budget.md` prices the surface; the deleted polarity is in the
// history if it is ever wanted back.

// The light polarity's own tokens stood here — `PILL_RIM_ON_LIGHT`, `PILL_RIM_LIT_ON_LIGHT` and
// the `COOL_600` ink above — and they went with it. They were live `pub` colour codes that nothing
// read, which in a file whose whole claim is "the only place a colour code is written down" reads

//
// **Why this is not the card triple above.** Two independent reasons, and both of them are about
// being able to SEE THROUGH the thing casting the shadow.
//
// 1. A card hides whatever ink lands beneath it, so the card numbers were only ever tuned as a
//    CONTACT — a tight 11px falloff at 0.34, read as the few px of it that escape past the tile's
//    edge. Under a 7% wash the whole pool is on show, and at that weight and that tightness it
//    reads as a drawn edge rather than as distance from the page. So this triple goes the other
//    way: far wider, a third of the gradient, no boundary anywhere in it. (Note it is the GRADIENT
//    that drops, not the ink — the alpha ends up slightly higher than the card's, see `_A`.)
// 2. A 250x375 poster and a 560x400 prose panel are not the same object. The same falloff that
//    disappears round a card's short arcs runs for hundreds of px along a straight edge here,
//    which is precisely where the eye finds a line.
//
// (The FRAME the owner rejected on 2026-08-21 was a third thing again, and it was geometry, not
// weight: `Painter::shadow`'s box cut leaves a full-strength band under the occluder's own rim.
// `Painter::shadow_outside` cuts the rounded shape instead. These constants are what makes what is
// left read as a lift; the cut is what stopped it reading as a box.)
/// Penumbra (px) of the translucent panel's lift — **four times the card's**, and that ratio is the
/// whole point. What makes a soft edge a SEEN one is the gradient, not the ink: the field peaks at
/// half the alpha (the contact line, at the panel's own edge) and falls to nothing over this
/// distance, so the card's 0.34-over-11px runs at ~0.015 alpha/px while this runs at ~0.005/px.
