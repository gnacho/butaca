//! **Track information** — the detail page's file inspector (`Alert Views.dc.html` §1B).
//!
//! One glass panel answering "what actually IS this file": the container and its size, the video
//! stream's own technicals, the Dolby Vision layering when there is any, and then EVERY audio and
//! subtitle track the part carries. It is opened with OK on the About footer's **Languages**
//! column — the block that lists those tracks — and closed by BACK; it has no controls of its own,
//! only a scroll. (It hung off a ⓘ disc in the detail hero until 2026-08-21; `detail::hero_ctls`
//! records why the door moved to the block the panel is about.)
//!
//! **Why the track list lives here and not in a panel of its own** is the design's own reasoning,
//! and it is the thing to preserve if this screen is ever split: *"the audio list belongs beside
//! the bitrates in Track information rather than in a panel of its own"*. Seven of this file's
//! eight audio tracks are Russian AC3 5.1 — language and codec alone do not tell them apart, and
//! the numbers that do are the same numbers the FILE and VIDEO columns are made of. Separated,
//! neither half answers the question.
//!
//! ## Three things here are not obvious
//!
//! **1. The feather is per-RUN, not per-pixel.** The design masks the scrolling body with an 88px
//! `linear-gradient` at whichever edge has more content behind it. This renderer has no vertical
//! mask: `fs_text_fade.frag` fades on `v_tuv.x` (a string's own width — `TextView::fade_last`'s
//! right-edge dissolve) and there is no y-axis twin. So the ramp is applied as a CASCADE ALPHA per
//! text run, evaluated at that run's cap-band centre ([`feather_alpha`]), inside a hard
//! `Painter::clip` that bounds the band exactly. The body is 100% text, so nothing escapes it.
//!
//! `table.rs` carries a warning that reads like a contradiction and is not: it replaced the track
//! menu's old fade masks with a hard scissor because *"a tall two-line edge row is cut uniformly
//! (the fade left its title bright but faded its detail line, which read as a broken clip)"*. That
//! fade was inconsistent — it dissolved some of a row's runs and not others. This one is monotone
//! in y over every run without exception, which is what a gradient IS; a label at the top of the
//! band being brighter than its own value 36px below it is the ramp working, not a broken clip.
//! The honest cost is RESOLUTION: at ~30-40px per run an 88px feather is sampled 2-3 times rather
//! than continuously. A per-pixel version means a y-axis text-fade program, which is a fill-rate
//! change on a fill-rate-bound Mali and so needs a device measurement before it is worth it — see
//! `docs/glass-hardware-budget.md`. The simulator cannot answer that question.
//!
//! **2. Codecs are named TECHNICALLY here, and that is deliberate.** `AC3`, `EAC3`, `MOV_TEXT`,
//! `HEVC` — not `metadata::friendly_codec`'s "Dolby Digital". The two surfaces are asking
//! different questions: `ui::track_menu` is a CHOOSER, where the friendly name is what a viewer
//! recognises, and this is a file INSPECTOR, where the container's own spelling is the answer. The
//! mock spells them this way for the same reason, and `track_menu`'s own trailing badge already
//! uses `codec.to_uppercase()`, so this is not a new spelling in the app.
//!
//! **3. Language names are the SERVER's, so they are not English.** The wire sends
//! `language: "Русский"` and `"Українська"` for this file; the mock's `renderVals` writes
//! "Russian" and "Ukrainian" because its author normalised them by hand. We render what the server
//! said, which is what `ui::track_menu` already does with the same tracks — the app must not name
//! one track two ways on two screens — and `appfont.ttf` (Inter) covers Cyrillic in full.
