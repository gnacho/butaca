//! The **item context menu** — the popover a press-and-hold opens on a home shelf tile, on the same
//! [`Popover`] + [`TableView`] pair as the track menu and the profile menu.
//!
//! The reference is **Apple TV's card menu, not Plex's**: a panel anchored BESIDE the focused card
//! (the card and the rest of the shelf stay where they are, visible behind it), rows of
//! `[leading icon] [label]`, the focused row a filled light pill spanning the panel, and a hairline
//! separator between the navigation actions and the state actions. Plex's own version is a
//! full-screen sheet; that is deliberately not what this is.
//!
//! It exists because OK on a Continue Watching tile **resumes immediately, by design** — the amber
//! play badge on the card is the affordance that says so. The hold is the *other* half of that
//! interaction, and until it existed Go-to-Show, per-item Mark-as-Watched and Play-from-Start had
//! nowhere to live (`docs/parity-gaps.md` §1.2/§1.3, §5a).
//!
//! **Every card surface opens it**, through two builders and one presenter. [`open`] serves the
//! card rows — a home shelf, the Library browse grid, a Search result shelf, a person's filmography
//! and the detail page's Related shelf — and [`open_episode`] the detail page's episode filmstrip
//! (the owner-reported gap: a long press on an episode still did nothing, so there was nowhere to
//! mark an episode watched). The row SET differs only because a navigation row that leads to the
//! page you are standing on is not an action; everything else — the panel, the placement, the
//! choreography, the state rows — is shared.
//!
//! **The Related shelf was the last card surface to join, and it is worth knowing why it was late.**
//! It was excluded on the grounds that its tiles carried no `(ratingKey, watched)` pair to build
//! rows from — which was true of the struct behind them and never of the data: `/related` returns
//! the same wire DTO as every other listing, and `fetch_related` copied three fields out of it and
//! dropped the rest. So the fix was upstream (`metadata::Related` is a real `pms::PmsMovie` now),
//! and this module needed nothing: a Related tile takes [`open`], because it is a card row like the
//! others and NOT a leaf of the season the page beneath it has loaded.
//!
//! **What remains excluded is excluded for a reason that does not dissolve.** A tile that is a
//! PERSON or a TAG has no rating key and no watch state at all, so every row this module can build
//! would be absent and the hold would open an empty panel: the detail page's cast headshots, and
//! Search's Cast & Crew / Collections rows (`search::Item::Tag` has no rating key). A hold there
//! keeps doing nothing, deliberately.
//!
//! Like [`crate::ui::account_menu`], this module only **reports** the chosen [`Action`]; `app.rs`
//! performs the routing, the server call and the hub refresh. It never mutates playback or PMS
//! state itself.
