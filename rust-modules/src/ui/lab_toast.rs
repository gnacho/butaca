//! The lab upload's read-out: **"Uploading diagnostics…" → "Diagnostics uploaded" or a reason**.
//!
//! Lab builds only (`crate::lab`), and it is the only thing this feature ever puts on screen. Its
//! whole job is to answer, in a rented Cloud Test Lab hour with no console and no log, the one
//! question a tester has after pressing the button: *did anything happen*. A silent trigger and a
//! trigger that is not delivered at all look identical, and one of those is a bug in this feature
//! while the other is the colour-button question (`docs/lab-diagnostics.md` §7) — so the read-out
//! appears the moment the press is TAKEN, before the network is involved, and then changes.
//!
//! # Where it sits, and why not where the other read-out sits
//!
//! Top RIGHT normally; immediately BELOW `ui::stats` when both are shown. The diagnostics panel is
//! the state, the toast is whether the state got out, and neither may cover the other. Both stay
//! inside the overscan frame (`consts::MARGIN_X`) because a lab set is one nobody here can measure,
//! so nothing may rely on the panel showing every pixel.
//!
//! It takes NO KEYS: it is not a route, not a modal and has no dismiss. Every key keeps doing what
//! it did, which matters when the upload is triggered from the playback failure read-out — the
//! screen a tester most wants a snapshot of, and one whose own key arm swallows everything.
