//! `CardRow` — the shared animated poster-shelf component.
//!
//! Extracts the home shelf's per-row animation state (a focus-scale [`Spring`] per cell + a
//! horizontal scroll spring) and its tile rendering (poster + big glow focus ring + resume bar +
//! centered title) into ONE reusable widget, so the home `Grid` and the detail Related row are
//! literally the same component — [`RowStyle::HOME`] is the single source of the shelf's motion and
//! geometry that both screens read.
//!
//! What stays per-caller is only the x/`base_y` positioning loop, because home threads `env.sp` and
//! splits the loop across the `Grid`'s two-pass **cross-row** focused-last z-order (invariant #3 in
//! `ui/CLAUDE.md`) — which a lone detail row doesn't have. So `CardRow` deliberately owns spring
//! state + the leaf tile draws, and NEVER draws a whole row or applies an in-row focused-last pass
//! on a caller's behalf. It's decoupled from any focus globals / catalog: focus is a plain
//! `Option<usize>`, the item art is a [`Art`] the caller supplies.
