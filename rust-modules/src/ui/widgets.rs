// 1A/1B/1C all carry it, 1E states the rule: the panels that hold no control close on BACK, so the
// line IS the whole affordance) and the line the player's failure read-out already carried.
//
// **The cap is the point, not decoration.** `BACK` set in the same prose as the words around it
// reads as a word; the same three letters inside a keyline read as the thing under your thumb. That
// distinction has to survive a PHOTOGRAPH of a television in an issue thread, which is the failure
// read-out's whole output format, and a keyline survives a phone camera's chroma subsampling where
// a colour or weight change does not.
//
// The idiom was written first as a private `draw_hint_with_keycap` in `player_hud.rs`, screen-local
// and centred on `SCR_W`. It is here because the alert panels want the same object RIGHT-aligned
// inside a panel, and the guide's rule 4 answers that: promote the widget, don't fork it. Three
// alert lanes reached for it independently and all three rejected the HUD's CONSTRUCTION for the
// same reason, below.
//
// **The cap is a genuinely hollow ring in the LABEL'S OWN INK**, which is `keyline_chip`'s
// construction and its measured reason — read that one before retuning either. The HUD's original
// drew the ring as a knockout (a white-at-.34 rounded rect, then the interior repainted OPAQUE
// BLACK) and got away with it because the video plane behind the read-out is black by construction.
// On a glass panel that interior is a black hole punched through the frost. Going hollow is
// therefore forced — and the alpha cannot come with it: at [`KEYCAP_W`] 1.5 the SDF's rim coverage
// is the product of two 1.5px smoothsteps, whose overlap is about a quarter of a pixel, so a
// stated `.34` resolves to roughly a tenth of that on screen. `keyline_chip` measured it (~12
// levels above ground where the arithmetic says ~87). Opaque ink is what makes a 1.5px ring exist.
//
// **`player_hud::draw_hint_with_keycap` is DELIBERATELY NOT migrated onto this, and that is a
// decision rather than an oversight.** Two of the three lanes did migrate it and one refused; the
// refusal is what shipped. Going hollow is not a no-op on that screen — it trades a .34 white
// knockout for opaque `TEXT_SECONDARY`, so the cap gets brighter on the one screen whose whole
// design brief is "survive a phone photograph in an issue thread". That is a DEVICE look, gradeable
// only on the television and not on a host simulator, so the failure read-out keeps its own cap
// until someone can put the two side by side on the panel. The cost is a second cap construction in
// the tree, which is why it is written down here rather than left to be rediscovered as duplication
// worth cleaning up.

// SECTION read-out is the one case where a smaller frame is the honest answer rather than a dodge:

// The diagnostics overlay's list primitive (`ui/stats.rs`), and the reason it is not a
// `TableView`: that is a SELECTION widget. It paints an accent pill under row `sel` on every draw
// with no "nothing selected" mode, its rows are 60px so ~25 of them measure 1540 against a 1080
// panel and SCROLL behind a scissor, and a row is `label` + optional sub-line + badges — there is
// no right-hand value column at all. A read-out needs the opposite of all three: no selection, no
// scrolling (a panel the user must scroll is two photographs and a chance of missing the line that
// mattered), and a fixed value column. Nothing here was close, which is the condition ui/CLAUDE.md
// sets for a new component.
//
// It owns no state, no focus and no springs: hand it a slice and a frame and it draws.

/// A read-out value's severity. Carried by a WORD in the value text as well as by this tint —

///   a second caller on `gfx::sample_ground`, which has one latch and one rate counter: the two
///   would halve each other's sampling rate and clobber each other's answer.
/// * **The chip suppresses the track's glass while it is expanded.** Focusing the chip would then
///   strip the material off a control the focus never touched — the "material that steps reads as
///   broken" failure `K_TRACK_DENSITY_ATTACK` exists to keep out, at the largest scale available.
/// * **Merge the two into one surface whose rect is their union.** The union spans the ~300px of
///   bare hero BETWEEN them; drawing it as one capsule paints material over a gap the design shows
///   the picture through. It is the right answer only in the case the geometry now forbids.
///
/// So: one solve, one backdrop publisher, one local consumer. The track samples the ground because
/// it is the surface the ground question was posed about; the chip takes the answer without joining
/// the blur region. The band cannot be two densities because there is only one face value.
///
/// # What the shared face still costs — the chip's ink is not solved for its own ground
///
/// This is the half the four bullets above do not price, and it is not small. `track_alpha_for` is

/// At L\* 80 it is 2.54:1. Nothing in the app darkens the top band before this — `home`'s
/// atmospheric ramp starts at `HERO_BASE_SCRIM_Y0` (367) and the hero wedge at `HERO_SCRIM_TOP`
/// (162) — so those are raw backdrop pixels, and `gfx::sample_ground`'s own note records a census
/// finding a MEDIAN 26.8 L\* span across five taps of the track alone, a third of heroes over 40.

/// **It is not settled, and the shape of the answer is not obvious**, which is why it is written

/// the page does; the lift is the shortfall, so
///
/// ```text
/// face = max(lum·(1 - a), floor)     g = max(0, (floor - lum·(1 - a)) / a)

/// That form was chosen over the two obvious alternatives, both of which were tried:
///
/// * A **proportional** target ("the face should sit N% off the page") degenerates at zero, which

/// * **Blending** between a light target and the dark one crosses the page's own level on the way
///   — measured, it passed within 0.4 of a code at a ground of .14, i.e. it moved the invisible bar

///
/// A floor still meets the page exactly once, at `lum = floor`, but that is a page at L\*3 and the
/// band around it is a couple of codes wide. Everywhere above it the scrim is doing the separating,
/// which is what it was sized for.
///
/// The answer is finally walked back until the idle label still clears [`TRACK_INK_CONTRAST`]: the

/// darkest quarter of the frame by construction (the hero wedge is what buys their labels their
/// contrast), so there is nothing behind them to bend. Measured on the dev set's own Home: the
/// blurred face moves a control's pixels by at most 7/255 while this rim moves them by up to 74.
/// Dropping the backdrop also drops the thing that made controls unaffordable — a glass surface is
/// charged for its rectangle unioned with every other, and Home's action row unioned with a glass
/// tab track priced at 3.8x the frame budget. A rim costs one extra fragment op on the perimeter.
///
/// **The weights are the TILE's, plus the container's lamp**: [`theme::CARD_SHEEN`] .22 round the
/// whole perimeter — a card's own edge, because a control face has a card's problem, it sits over
/// artwork nobody chose — and the boost to [`theme::GLASS_RIM_LIGHT`] .28 on the side facing the
/// light, weighted by the surface normal, so a disc's highlight sits on its crown and fades to
/// nothing at its equator. One lamp, the one every card shadow in this app is already cast from.
///
/// The perimeter used to be [`theme::GLASS_RIM`] .14, the GLASS container's line, which was a
/// category error by the design system's own rule: `tokens/glass.css` scopes that pair to a surface
/// you read THROUGH and says in the same breath that every control is flat. A flat control wears the
/// card constant. The crown stays the glass hairline because that is what it is — a specular line
/// from the shared lamp, not a second perimeter — so the edge now runs .22 → .28 instead of
/// .14 → .28, and this rim is the ONLY thing separating a control from its ground since the drop
/// shadow went (`Button::draw`).
///
/// Unconditional on focus, which is the point: the design's rule is that the card constants are not

//     this?" — that a WORD solves for free, and that naming the provider solves *lawfully*, since
//     referential use needs no licence where a mark does.
//
// So a group is: the provider's name as a quiet MICRO caption in TEXT_TERTIARY, then its score or
// scores. That inverts what carried the colour. Before, four saturated brand marks competed with
// the hero art and with each other; now the captions recede to caption weight and the ONLY colour
// left in the row is the verdict — a red or gold or hollow tomato, a green or drained crowd. The
// row reads as one rhythm instead of four logos.
//
// Rotten Tomatoes is ONE group with two scores under one caption, because critics and audience are
// two readings from one source; IMDb and TMDB are one score each. That is also why this draws a
// GROUP rather than a badge: the caption is shared, so the unit that knows how to lay itself out
// is the provider, not the score.
