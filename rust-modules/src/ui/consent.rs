//! **The consent routes** — two independent choices, asked once, changeable forever after.
//!
//! This is the surface every other part of the telemetry work waits on: nothing may be collected
//! before it has been shown and answered, so until it existed `telemetry::consent`'s transition
//! functions had no caller and carried `#[allow(dead_code)]` saying so. It is also the screen most
//! likely to decide what people think of the whole feature, which is why the wording below is
//! argued for rather than filled in.
//!
//! # Why it looks like this
//!
//! **Two purposes, two decisions.** Crash reports and usage statistics are judged as different
//! things by the people who care about them, so first run asks them on consecutive route states
//! with equal one-press Share / Don’t Share answers. Nothing is stored until both have been
//! answered. Settings then represents the stored answers as two independent switches.
//!
//! **One route-screen composition.** First run and Settings share [`RouteLayout`]: measured
//! narrative flow on the left, the canonical [`TableView`] on the right, and one bottom action
//! slot. Privacy Policy and the exact-payload preview push to the same [`DocumentReader`] contract
//! as Legal documents; they are not alert sheets and do not introduce a second navigation model.
//!
//! **The prose is first-person and short.** WP260 permits layering: this screen needs who, why,
//! that it is optional and reversible, and where to read the rest — and the rest is one push away
//! on the SAME screen, `ui::legal`'s `PRIVACY`, which carries the full Art. 13 narrative including
//! retention, rights, transfers and what uninstalling does. `PRIVACY.md` is the same narrative as a
//! repo file, plus the generated event/field schema tables; it is NOT what any screen serves and is
//! not reachable from one. This paragraph used to say the exhaustive list lived in that file
//! "behind the Legal screen", which pointed a contributor at the surface a television owner and a
//! store reviewer never see — the two must be updated together, and the screen is the one that
//! must not be allowed to fall behind. A legalistic register would be worse here than a
//! plain one, and not only tonally: a solo MIT project writing like a legal department is what reads
//! as pretending to be a company, which is the thing this audience reacts to.
//!
//! **"What is actually sent" renders every literal schema** — Syncthing's preview, and the reason
//! the claim below it is checkable rather than reassuring. Usage examples go through the real
//! serializer. Native and fallback examples replace random/build-specific runtime values with
//! explicit placeholders; handled playback and usage examples show representative members of
//! their closed fixed domains. Tests compare object keys with the sanitizer/schema allowlists, so
//! an added field cannot bypass this screen.
//!
//! **Item 14: it is TWO documents, one per telemetry channel, not one.** `preview_crash` and
//! `preview_usage` each build and render only their own channel's schemas — Sentry's crash/error
//! envelopes, or PostHog's usage events — so a person reading "what crash reports send" is never
//! shown a usage identifier or event, and the reverse. Settings shows both rows; first run shows
//! only the one the current question is actually asking about. The two functions never run
//! together except inside a test's own `preview()` union, which nothing on screen ever shows.
//!
//! # It is asked ONCE PER TELEVISION, before the profile picker
//!
//! **Consent here is a DEVICE decision, not a per-viewer preference**, and the storage always said
//! so: `telemetry_candidates()` is one file with no profile key, so whoever answers binds every
//! profile on the set. Until 2026-09-02 it was nevertheless asked on first arrival at Home — i.e.
//! *after* who's-watching — which put a data-protection question to whichever household member
//! happened to be picked, up to and including a managed child profile, and made a device-wide
//! answer look like a personal setting. It is now asked as soon as there is an authorized account
//! and before the picker, so the person who signed the television in is the person who answers.
//!
//! # BACK navigates; it never answers
//!
//! The two choices are consecutive route states. BACK from Product returns to Crash. **BACK from
//! Crash does nothing**, and that is the placement's one real cost: the step behind it is sign-in,
//! which cannot be undone, so there is no route to restore and the crumb above the title is
//! absent. It is not a trap — both answers are one press and refusing costs nothing — but it is
//! the reason this route is the root of its own ceremony rather than a step in the boot wizard.
//! From Settings, BACK discards the draft and Done appears only after a stored value changes.
//!
//! # It never appears on an automated boot
//!
//! [`should_show`] takes `dev::any_trigger_present()`. Getting this wrong would not fail loudly:
//! `tests/run.py` injects a token and expects Home, the fps scenes grade a heartbeat on a known
//! route, and every `sim-shot` script drives a screen it chose — a consent prompt in front of all
//! of them would quietly re-point the entire harness at a screen nobody wrote an assertion for.
