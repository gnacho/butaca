//! The typed result shelves.
//!
//! ## The design
//!
//! Shelves in a **fixed** order — `crate::search::KINDS` — and an empty type draws nothing at all.
//! Ranking is honoured inside a shelf and never across them: the server reorders its hubs per
//! query (measured), and reordering rows per keystroke moves the row under the user's focus while
//! they are still typing.
//!
//! Tile geometry is per type: posters 250×375, episode stills 420×236, headshots a 250 circle.
//! Collections are posters. An item with no artwork mounts no slot — the tile's own skeleton face
//! is the resting state for art the server has not given us, which for a collection is always
//! (`Directory` entries carry no thumb).
//!
//! The heading is HEADLINE bold, the count BODY/tertiary beside it. Every search shelf merges
//! across sources, so the heading **cannot claim an owner** — the owner annotation follows FOCUS,
//! exactly as Continue Watching's does on Home, and rides on the focused tile's own caption.
//!
//! One caption on screen at a time, as every other shelf in this app does it: the label belongs to
//! the focused tile and nothing else carries type under its artwork. The band is reserved either
//! way ([`super::LABEL_BLOCK`]) so nothing reflows as focus travels.
//!
//! ## What it is built on
//!
//! [`card_row::strip`] — the one-row loop — with [`card_row::TileLabel::height`] reserving the
//! label band, the way `ui/person.rs`'s `draw_shelf` already stacks several shelves over one scroll
//! flow. Every tile treatment a poster wears elsewhere in the app therefore travels here for free:
//! the focus pop and its lifted shadow, the amber resume bar, the watched tick.
//!
//! ## Five things that are not obvious from the picture
//!
//! **1. The flow is authored; the lift is paint.** A shelf's block is `HEAD_TO_ROW` + the tile +
//! [`super::LABEL_BLOCK`], and [`stack_top`] stacks them — the ONE vertical geometry this screen
//! has. The draw reads it and so does the scroll rule ([`reveal_shelf`], which `super`'s
//! `scroll_target` is now a single line over); the pointer reads rects RECORDED at draw, which is
//! the same geometry observed rather than a second derivation of it.
//!
//! It claimed that before and it was false: `super` carried its own `block_h`/`shelf_top`/
//! `content_h` and its own scroll policy, disagreeing by [`BOTTOM_PAD`], each half green under its
//! own test. **The policy that survived is the minimal reveal below, not the pin** the mock spells
//! as `shift() = min(blockTop − CONTENT_TOP, max)`. Three reasons, in order of weight. Every other
//! vertical shelf flow in this app is [`card_row::reveal`] — `home.rs`'s grid, `person.rs`'s
//! `reveal_block`, the Library grid — so pinning would make Search the one screen that jumps. The
//! pin's stated justification in `super` ("nothing clips the flow") went stale the day [`draw`]
//! gained a real scissor: a shelf above the focused one is now CUT at the field, where before it
//! would have painted up through the chrome. And the shipped pin was not the mock's anyway — the
//! mock clamps to `end − SCR_H + 40`, and that 40 is [`BOTTOM_PAD`], which `super::content_h`
//! omitted, so the last shelf's caption band sat flush on the panel edge with no air under it.
//!
//! What a user sees for it: stepping from shelf 0 to shelf 1 moves the page 306px instead of 549,
//! so the row above stays half on screen rather than leaving entirely, and the bottom of the flow
//! keeps 40px under the last caption.
//!
//! The focused shelf's heading *rises* over its magnified tile, and that rise is `CardRow::lift()`:
//! the shared clearance rule, `tile height × (focus_scale − 1) ÷ 2` (16.9px on a poster row — the
//! design's 17), tapered by how near the popped tile is to the heading. It moves nothing below it.
//!
//! **2. The owner annotation is a FADE with its swap at the floor.** A heading here cannot claim an
//! owner, so the run follows focus — and focus can step straight from one borrowed source to
//! another. A point of ink cannot cross-fade between two different words, so [`Owner`] holds the
//! run it is currently naming, drives its alpha to zero whenever the target differs, adopts the new
//! one while it is invisible and rises again: the same Out/Hold/In shape `ui::xfade` has one
//! altitude up. With no source there is no run, no dot, no pad and no draw call at all, which is
//! how a single-server library pays nothing for the feature.
//!
//! **3. Only VISIBLE tiles may resolve a texture.** `card_row::strip` culls off-axis columns for
//! us; the vertical half is this module's, so a shelf whose whole block is off screen is skipped
//! before `strip` is entered. The poster LRU is 64 slots and one query answers with five shelves.
//!
//! **4. A new result set starts at its left edge.** The store clears its shelves on the keystroke
//! and refills them when the answer lands, so a row whose item COUNT changed is re-seated rather
//! than left holding the scroll offset of a different query's results.
//!
//! **5. The springs are stepped from [`update`], which `super::update` calls once a frame** — the
//! ordinary shape, and the reason this module owes the frame gate no clock of its own. Both spring
//! integrators report to `ui::idle::note_spring` from the inside, and the update phase runs before
//! `should_present`, so the shelves' motion is seen for free.
//!
//! Worth spelling out because it was not always so. A region's whole contract is
//! `draw(Painter, &View)` — no dt — so this module used to advance from its own monotonic clock
//! inside [`draw`], and then had to report the DISCRETE way (`ui::idle::invalidate`) against an
//! exact per-row motion signature, because **`note_spring` cannot speak for a spring stepped in a
//! draw**: `app.rs` runs `idle::frame_begin` → update → `should_present` → draw, and `frame_begin`
//! clears the motion flag at the top of the next iteration, so a report raised during frame N's
//! draw is wiped before anything reads it. All of it existed only because the one-line caller did
//! not, and all of it is gone with the caller in place.
//!
//! [`step_owner`]'s `invalidate` is the one report that stays, and for a different reason: the
//! adopt frame changes the run's WORDS with the spring at rest on the floor, and no integrator can
//! speak for a change that carries no motion.
//!
//! ## Why there is no `#![allow(dead_code)]` here any more
//!
//! There was one, on this file and on `super`, and it is what let ~130 lines of rival flow —
//! geometry, scroll rule, hit-test, all of it tested and green — sit here with no caller anywhere
//! in the crate while `super` ran its own copy. Nothing but the compiler was ever going to notice
//! that. Do not put a blanket back to quiet a seam that is still being built: give the seam a
//! caller, or say in its doc that it has none and why.
