//! The empty-query state: the user's own recent searches, and the control that clears them.
//!
//! ## The design
//!
//! Rows, not a shelf: nothing here has artwork. They use TableView's own geometry on the app's
//! ground instead of inside a panel — [`table::ROW_H`] tall, [`table::SIDE`] margins,
//! [`table::CONTENT_X`] inside, the focus pill inset by [`table::PILL_INSET`], HEADLINE labels.
//! Every one of those numbers is IMPORTED from that widget rather than restated here, so a row
//! height change there moves this block with it (it did not until 2026-08-14, and the mismatch was
//! invisible: [`BLOCK_BOTTOM`] is what the keyboard-clearance test pins, and it was derived from
//! this module's own copies).
//! Written as markup rather than mounted as a [`table::TableView`] for one reason, and
//! it is worth keeping: **these rows are the user's own words and have to stay editable in place.**
//!
//! Above them sits a section HEADER, not a heading — it names the source of the rows, so it sits a
//! full step BELOW their labels: CAPTION, caps, tertiary, on the same [`table::HDR_H`] band
//! TableView reserves. At HEADLINE it read as another row.
//!
//! It is **placed by cap band and not by TableView's number.** That widget draws its own header at
//! a raw `sy + 8.0` — the magic y `ui/CLAUDE.md` rule 3 bans outright — so copying it here would
//! spread the one thing the rule exists to stop. The two therefore sit ~6px apart. The fix is to
//! move `table.rs` onto [`Label`] as well, not to re-add the offset on this side; until then this
//! is the one that is right.
//!
//! Clearing is a **control, not another term**: it leaves the list and becomes a
//! [`crate::ui::widgets::Button`], so a verb never sits in the same column as the words you
//! searched for.
//!
//! **Five terms** ([`super::MAX_RECENTS`]). With the keyboard raised the header, the rows and the
//! Clear control all have to finish above its top edge (`SCR_H - super::KEYBOARD_H` = 756); this
//! block ends at [`BLOCK_BOTTOM`], which a host test pins against that line. The sixth is DROPPED,
//! not scrolled — a list you cannot see the end of asks to be paged, and there is no paging in this
//! product.
//!
//! It was FOUR until 2026-08-15, and the cap was not the thing that was wrong: `KEYBOARD_H` was a
//! guess 56px too tall, so the arithmetic said a fifth row would not clear a panel edge that does
//! not exist. Measuring the real panel put the fifth back with 66px to spare. The lesson is in the
//! test below rather than in the number — it grades the CLEARANCE, so the count is free to follow
//! whatever the panel actually does.
//!
//! ## Persistence
//!
//! The terms live in the session file beside the roster ([`crate::plex::session::Session`]'s
//! `recent_searches`), behind `#[serde(default, deserialize_with = "de_soft_vec")]` — a corrupt
//! entry costs that entry, never the session.
//!
//! The file is read at most once per **profile generation** ([`crate::plex::session::current_gen`],
//! bumped by every `set_current`), not once per frame: `count()` is called from the screen's draw.
//!
//! **The generation is a cache key; the SCOPING is in the storage shape.** A sign-out drops the
//! terms because `auth::sign_out` calls `session::clear()` (the file goes) and then
//! `set_current(None)` (the generation moves), so one account's terms cannot survive into the
//! next account's session. A Plex Home **profile switch keeps them apart** for a different
//! reason: `Session::recent_searches` is keyed by the Home user's `uuid`
//! ([`crate::plex::session::RecentSearches`]), read through `recents_for` and written through
//! `set_recents_for`, so each managed user has their own list and Clear reaches only their own.
//!
//! It was one flat `Vec<String>` on the `Session` until 2026-08-14, which made a search history
//! the ACCOUNT's rather than the person's — the next user's empty search screen offered back what
//! the previous one had looked for. Clearing on a switch would also have stopped that and is the
//! wrong fix: it costs you your own list every time you hand the remote over and take it back.
//!
//! `search::reset()` deliberately does NOT drop the terms. It runs on a plain SERVER switch too,
//! where the terms are still this person's, and the profile case is already answered by the key.
//!
//! **The file is written on a WORKER, never on the SDL thread** — see [`persist`].
