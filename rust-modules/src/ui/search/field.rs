//! The query LINE, its caret, and the scope block under it.
//!
//! ## The design, so it does not have to be re-derived from the mock
//!
//! - The field carries **no magnifier**. The pill above it is the mark, and repeating it here says
//!   nothing the screen has not already said.
//! - **There is no RIM, no rule, no capsule OUTLINE, and — since 2026-09-04 — no FILL either.** The
//!   query IS the type, at `size::HERO` on the flat ground; the design system's `SearchField`
//!   contract forbids a border on this control and that half never changed. It wore a full control
//!   face until 2026-08-30 (`ACCENT` focused, `CONTROL_IDLE_FILL` holding a query while focus was
//!   elsewhere), then briefly a flat `ACCENT` PLATE for one state only (issue 22, 2026-09-03) — and
//!   the owner rejected that plate on sight: "you made the search bar background white, while I
//!   wanted text to be white". The plate is gone for good. **Focus is carried by INK ALONE,
//!   permanently** — the design system's own `SearchField` contract, which the plate never actually
//!   had authority to override.
//! - Two focused states, distinguished by ink rather than by a face. `draw`'s `ink_target` picks
//!   the query's bright endpoint on `editing` alone — never a second spring, riding the SAME `hot`
//!   spring the ink always has either way. **Focused, not yet editing** — no caret, no keyboard, and
//!   now no plate to help — crosses to [`theme::FIELD_WAITING_INK`], a genuinely PURE white: this is
//!   what "I wanted text to be white" means once there is nothing else on screen to carry the
//!   signal. **Editing** drops back one stop, to [`theme::FIELD_EDITING_INK`] — the SAME near-white
//!   `TEXT_PRIMARY` stop this control's ink crossed to before issue 22 ever existed, and the caret's
//!   own colour, so glyph and bar read as one continuous line — because the blinking caret and the
//!   open keyboard already carry "you are editing this", and the brighter white is left for the
//!   state that has nothing else. Until 2026-09-02 the whole ink step was `TEXT_SECONDARY`→
//!   `TEXT_HEADING`, one stop, and from the couch it read as "this field has content" rather than
//!   "the remote is on it" (owner feedback) — which is the wide step both targets still ride today.
//!   The flip between the two targets is discrete, not a fade of its own, for the same reason the
//!   short-lived plate's `fill_t` never faded on `editing`: the keyboard raising is a discrete
//!   event, not a spring one. The placeholder stays one step behind the query ink at every `hot`,
//!   unconditionally on `editing` (`TEXT_TERTIARY`→`TEXT_SECONDARY`) — it is never shown once a real
//!   query needs the brighter ramp to itself.
//! - The placeholder is **unconditional**: an empty field is "Search your library" at the same
//!   rung in `TEXT_TERTIARY` — a step back from either query ink — never a bare caret on an empty
//!   row. **The caret sits at the field's own START while it is showing over a blank field**
//!   (issue 20): the placeholder is chrome nobody is editing, so it supplies no insertion point of
//!   its own to trail — see [`draw`]'s blank branch, which feeds `run_layout` a `caret_w` of zero
//!   rather than the placeholder's own width.
//! - The run scrolls so the **CARET** stays on screen — see [`run_layout`]. There is a real
//!   insertion point now (`super`'s `CARET`), because the television's own panel delegates its
//!   `◀`/`▶` keys to the app: the field is the thing that owns the text, so it is the thing that
//!   has to move the cursor. What there still is no route to is a POINTER cursor — no selection,
//!   no click-to-position.
//! - The caret is **5px wide and one CAP BAND tall**, sitting on the run's baseline, drawn only
//!   while `editing`, and **blinks**. This deliberately differs from the current `SearchField`
//!   component's solid bar: on the television a dead cursor read as a field that was not accepting
//!   input. `super::step_blink` reports only phase flips, so the open keyboard costs about two
//!   presents a second and a finished screen with the keyboard down stays idle.
//! - One character short of [`crate::search::MIN_QUERY`], the field adds **"one more character"**
//!   at `size::BODY` after the caret. It stays with the control whose state it explains and is
//!   consumed by the next keystroke; the recent terms below do not disappear for pressing a key.
//! - The **scope line** sits UNDER the query at `super::SCOPE_Y`, left-aligned on the app's own
//!   margin — a 72px line has no right-hand half to put a caption in. It is stated in EVERY state,
//!   one source included: this is the one screen where you cannot see what you are looking at. One
//!   plain fact, no warning tint and no Retry (the retry that re-kicks one source lives on that
//!   section's Library).
//!
//! ## The two pieces of arithmetic worth extracting
//!
//! [`run_layout`], [`run_and_head`], [`run_caret_w`], [`descent_pad`], [`ink_target`] and
//! [`scope_text`] are **pure**, and host-tested below, because
//! each is the kind of thing that is wrong by a few pixels, one word or one byte and invisible in a
//! screenshot — and [`run_and_head`]'s failure is not cosmetic at all, since a slice cut off a char
//! boundary panics inside the SDL event loop. They are not the whole risk, though — [`draw`] and
//! [`draw_scope`] carry the composition (the scissor pair and four placements),
//! and that is where a defect hides from both the tests and the eye. The registry projection the
//! scope line is written from is no longer part of that: it is [`with_scope`], built once per change
//! and shared with [`super::empty`] — see the section comment above it for what that fixed.

///    interior NUL, so the capsule would blank while the Rust string stayed non-empty — a field
///    refusing to show its own text — and the caret would be placed against the wrong length.
/// 2. **The caret, back to a CHAR BOUNDARY of the run** — not merely `min(len)`, which is the shape
///    this was written as and the reason it is now a function. `min` bounds the LENGTH and says
///    nothing about the boundary, so it is only sound while the incoming offset is already a
///    boundary of *this* slice. `super::caret` does clamp against the live query, so nothing in the

// over one registry is two answers to "what is a source", printed one line apart on the screen.
//
// It is MEMOISED for the second half of the same problem. Rebuilt inside a draw, that join cost a
// `Vec<Scope>`, a `Vec<&str>` per source (`library_titles` collects over the whole section table),
// two more from `name_set`'s partition, a `String` per label, `join`'s vec, a `format!`, `elide`'s

// setup the line exists for, on the one screen that presents continuously while the user types,
// for a sentence that changes about twice a session. Both neighbouring regions already refused it
// — `recents` borrows where it could clone, and `empty`'s own count walked the roster rather than
// collecting it — which made this the outlier. `widgets::with_tab_metrics` is the in-tree pattern
// it follows: hold the result against a generation, rebuild only when the generation moves.

/// Everything the projection reads, in a form that can be compared every frame without touching
