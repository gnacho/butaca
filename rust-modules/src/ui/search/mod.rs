//! search — the Search screen (`ui_kits/tv-app/SearchScreen.jsx` in the design system).
//!
//! The last pill in the shared top strip, and the only one that is a mark instead of a word. Text
//! entry is the TELEVISION's own keyboard ([`crate::textinput`]), so this screen owns no keyboard
//! layout at all: it owns the field, the live result set behind the raised panel, and the handoff
//! back to the shelves on ▼.
//!
//! ## Split across five files, deliberately
//!
//! This module is the state machine — zones, focus, scroll, and the draw ORDER — and nothing else.
//! Each region draws itself:
//!
//! | file | draws |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`field`] | the bare query line, its caret + one-character hint, and the scope below |
//! | [`recents`] | the empty-query state: the user's own recent terms, and Clear |
//! | [`results`] | the typed shelves |
//! | [`empty`] | "You haven't searched yet" / "No results for …" |
//!
//! Every one takes the same [`View`] snapshot, so a region can never read a different focus than
//! the one the state machine believes in.
//!
//! ## The layout rule that explains the numbers
//!
//! With the keyboard raised, **nothing the app owns hides behind it**. The TV puts the panel over
//! the bottom [`KEYBOARD_H`], so its top edge is at **756** (measured, see that constant), and the
//! field, the first shelf's heading and that shelf's full row of posters all finish above it:
//! [`CONTENT_TOP`] 300 + [`HEAD_TO_ROW`] 60 + a 375-tall poster = **735**, twenty-one clear.
//! (This paragraph has now been wrong twice, in opposite directions: first 699 — "exactly on its
//! top edge", a number `CONTENT_TOP` = 264 would give and nothing draws — then 700, from a
//! `KEYBOARD_H` nobody had measured. `results`'
//! `the_first_shelfs_whole_row_clears_the_raised_keyboard` asserts the real figures, for every tile
//! size a first shelf can have, which is why the correction was a two-line edit rather than an
//! archaeology exercise.) That clearance is also why nothing scrolls while the panel is up: the
//! result set has to be stable under the user's eyes while they are still typing.
//!
//! ## The ▼ handoff, which is the rule the whole state machine exists for
//!
//! ▼ off the field lands on something **that is DRAWN**, and on nothing otherwise — [`below`] is
//! the one expression that answers it, and [`draw`] dispatches its regions from the same call, so
//! the zone focus moves to and the region on screen can never be two different answers. With no
//! query and no remembered terms there is nothing under the field at all, and the press is a
//! no-op: focus staying visibly put is the honest report, where dropping it into an invisible list
//! is a screen the remote has silently stopped addressing.
//!
//! ## Scroll
//!
//! One spring, and only the SHELVES ride it ([`View::shift`]): the field, the strip and the recents
//! rows are chrome at fixed y. **The flow's whole shape lives in [`results`]** — this module owns
//! the two FREEZES ([`scroll_frozen`]) and nothing else about it, and asks
//! [`results::reveal_shelf`] for the rest.
//!
//! The rule is the shared minimal reveal (`card_row::reveal`, as the home grid, the person page and
//! the Library grid all scroll), **not** the mock's pin of the focused block to [`CONTENT_TOP`];
//! `results`' module doc carries that decision and the reasons. This paragraph used to describe the
//! pin and to call the second freeze "forced rather than chosen: nothing clips the flow", which
//! stopped being true when `results::draw` gained a real scissor at the field's bottom edge.
//!
//! So the freeze at zero whenever the shelves do not hold focus is now a CHOICE, and the reason it
//! stays is the ▼ handoff: it lands on shelf **0** and not on the shelf last left, and it can only
//! mean that if the flow is already back at 0 — restoring a deep row would jump the page under the
//! user's eyes at the exact moment they asked for a small move. The COLUMN is remembered (and
//! clamped), which is the half of "lands where you were" that costs nothing.
