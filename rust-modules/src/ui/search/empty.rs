//! The two states with no shelves: nothing searched yet, and nothing found.
//!
//! Both are **statements, not failures**: no alert mark, no danger tint, no Retry. Nothing found
//! is an answer the server gave, and dressing it as an error tells the user something untrue about
//! their library.
//!
//! ## The anatomy, which changed on 2026-08-15 and is the reason this doc is long
//!
//! Each state is **two parts, CENTRED in the band the app owns**: the region's own name in the caps
//! header face ([`crate::ui::table::HDR_H`]'s type role — CAPTION, uppercase, tertiary), then one
//! statement at `size::TITLE`. Same two parts, same order, same place for both, which is what makes
//! them read as one screen answering in one voice rather than as two unrelated read-outs.
//!
//! | state | header | statement |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | nothing searched | `RECENT SEARCHES` | Nothing searched yet |
//! | nothing found | `SEARCH RESULTS` | No results for “…” |
//!
//! The header is load-bearing and not decoration: an empty recents list is still **the recents
//! list**, so it keeps the name of the thing it is empty of — the header is the only part of the
//! populated layout that survives, and dropping it would make the empty state a different screen
//! rather than the same one with nothing in it.
//!
//! **Centred, and only because the column is gone.** The populated list is a left column under the
//! field, and the terms line up with the control that produced them; with no terms there is no
//! column to align to, and a lone sentence pinned to the left margin of an otherwise empty 1920
//! panel reads as a fragment. The band is [`band`] — below the field, above the raised keyboard —
//! so the statement sits in the middle of the space the app actually has, and MOVES when the panel
//! comes up. It was a left-aligned `HEADLINE` over a `CAPTION` scope hint at `CONTENT_TOP` before.
//!
//! **The scope hint is gone with it.** It said "Titles, people and collections in <server>." under
//! the headline, and it was the second place on one screen to state what is being searched — the
//! field's scope line below the query is the first. The design's note is that repeating it
//! "makes the screen look like it is arguing"; the consequence is that [`field::scope_text`] now
//! states the scope for a SINGLE source too, since this line is no longer there to carry that case.
//!
//! ## Plain copy, deliberately — not a [`StatusOverlay`]
//!
//! [`crate::ui::widgets::StatusKind::Empty`] is the right *reading* of "nothing found" and the
//! wrong *anatomy* for it, so this draws two [`Label`]s instead of mounting the component — and it
//! stays true now that this file centres, because centring was never the whole difference.
//! `StatusOverlay` fixes its own rungs (a `BODY` verdict over a `CAPTION` reason, neither bold) and
//! has no caps header at all; this is a caps kicker over a **bold TITLE**. Bending it to that means
//! adding a header slot and two size overrides to a component whose whole job is the one centred
//! read-out, after which every existing caller is one builder call away from drifting off it.
//!
//! The division that remains is the design's own point made in TYPE rather than only in tint: a
//! **statement** is page copy in the page's own voice; a **fault** is the app's read-out. See
//! [`draw`] for the one fault case that reaches this file.
