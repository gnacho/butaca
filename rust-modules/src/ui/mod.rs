static GUARD_RECOVERED: std::sync::atomic::AtomicBool = std::sync::atomic::AtomicBool::new(false);

/// Run one UI entry point (a screen's `draw`/`update`/key handler) behind a panic barrier: a panic
/// inside `f` unwinds only as far as this call, and the frame is abandoned instead of the process.
///
/// **Why this exists — it is not defensive programming, it is an FFI requirement.** `plex_run` is
/// `#[no_mangle] pub extern "C"` (the C boot shim in `src/main.c` calls it), and a panic that
/// unwinds *out of* an `extern "C"` frame is undefined behaviour; the toolchain lowers it to an
/// immediate `abort()`. Every UI draw runs inside that `extern "C"` frame, so on this device a
/// stray index-out-of-bounds in a screen is not "one bad frame" — it is SIGABRT, a dead app, a
/// live Starfish buffer-feed session torn down mid-`Feed()`, and the TV back at the launcher, with
/// no debugger attached to say why. Wrapping the DISPATCH (see `app.rs`, where the whole
/// route→screen draw is one guarded block) rather than each screen means a screen added later is
/// covered by construction instead of by its author remembering.
///
/// The `Err` arm **must** release the GL scissor. [`Painter::clip`] is global GL state that its
/// user pairs with a [`Painter::clip_clear`] at the end of the same draw (`TableView::draw` is the
/// one user today) — a panic between the two skips the clear, and every subsequent frame in the
/// process would then be silently scissored to whatever rect the dying screen last set, with
/// nothing downstream able to tell why the UI went partly blank. This unwind is the only place
/// that can see it happened, so this is the only place that can repair it.
///
/// **What this does NOT protect** (do not over-trust it):
/// - A panic on a **worker thread** — demux, load, timeline, poster/metadata/browse fetches. That
///   thread dies and its work silently stops; those bodies carry their own `catch_unwind`
///   (`metadata.rs`, `browse.rs`, `pms.rs`, `img.rs`, `player/mod.rs`).
/// - An **abort**, which `catch_unwind` cannot catch by construction: allocation failure, a double
///   panic (a second panic raised by a `Drop` running during *this* unwind), or a panic crossing
///   one of the OTHER `extern "C"` seams we hand to C — the libavformat AVIO callbacks in `ff.rs`
///   and the Starfish/ACB event callbacks. Those still kill the process.
/// - **Consistent state.** The guarded body ran halfway and whatever it mutated before panicking
///   stays mutated — `AssertUnwindSafe` is precisely the assertion that we accept that. The next
///   frame redraws from the same state, so a screen that panics once normally panics every frame;
///   this keeps the app alive and navigable, it does not fix the screen.
///
/// Main-thread only, and free on the happy path: `catch_unwind`'s landing pad is cold, so guarding
/// the per-frame draw dispatch is not a hot-path cost on the A53.

// off-frame children by index rather than scissor-clipping them (`Painter::clip` exists but is
// reserved for a bounded panel like the track menu; culling the whole document flow avoids per-frame
// scissor churn). This is an immediate-mode renderer — every frame clears + redraws the whole tree,
// so the way to "avoid drawing" is to CULL what isn't visible, not to dirty-track what changed. These are the ONE
// mechanism each: `on_axis` is the single off-screen cull test both screens call; `hero_alpha` the
// single hero-fade curve. `ScrollColumn`/`Column` is the scroll-into-content container detail
// composes its below-hero flow from (home's fixed-pitch grid is not a document flow, so it uses only
// the two leaf fns and keeps its own two-pass focused-last draw).

/// subtracted the scroll/offset), `extent` = its size along the axis, `span` = the viewport extent
/// (`SCR_W`/`SCR_H`), `lead` = slack past the near (0) edge (e.g. home's `GLOW_PAD` room for the
