//! Detail screen: a full-screen item page — the reused hero (no page dots) over the
//! item backdrop, with a vertical-scroll flow underneath for the episode/related/
//! cast rows and About footer (added in later increments). Reads the loaded item
//! from crate::metadata and the selected catalog row (backdrop art + blur) from the
//! browse catalog. Mirrors the home screen's C-shaped entry points (open/update/
//! draw/move_focus) driven by app.rs.
//!
//! The whole page sits on an ambient GROUND (`DetailView::amb`, keyed by `amb_blur`/`amb_target`):
//! the item's own `UltraBlurColors`, mixed toward `theme::SURFACE_APP` and held under the wash's
//! luminance ceiling, so the below-hero rows sit on the item's colours instead of the flat app grey.
//! Its envelope comes from the LOADED item first and the catalog row only as a stand-in, because
//! three of the four ways into this page (Library grid, Related tile, person page) are not in the
//! home hub catalog at all.
//!
//! The page serves EPISODES too, not only movies and shows — the home shelf's context menu ("Go to
//! Episode") and this page's own filmstrip both open `Route::Detail` on a leaf — so the backdrop
//! ladder ([`hero_art_path`]) has a rung for a leaf's own still, and every full-bleed blit `COVER`s
//! the panel rather than stretching to it (a still is a video frame whose aspect we do not control).
//! The episode filmstrip is correspondingly TWO focus rows deep ([`EpRow`]): the still, which plays,
//! and the metadata block under it, which opens that episode's page.

/// would silently answer `None` for every item reached that way. It then answers differently in
/// two places, and both are the two functions' questions genuinely differing:
///
/// * **A CONTAINER mid-run.** A poster in a grid says nothing about a show three episodes into ten,
///   because "where its next episode stands" is not something a tile can state. Here the question
///   is which write verbs are reachable, and such a show can honestly be sent to either end — so it
///   IS in the middle. (What the middle then GETS differs by surface: the menu lists both verbs, the
///   hero's toggle reads ✓, because a list may name two destinations and a toggle is one thing.)
/// * **The edges of the resume rule.** `resume` is [`hero_resume_ns`]'s answer, i.e. the resume the
///   Play pill beside this toggle would ACTUALLY apply, so a 4-second offset or a 95% tail is no
///   more "in the middle" here than it is a "Resume" up there — while a poster's bar is drawn from
///   a raw `viewOffset` and does mark them. This row promises what its presses deliver (the same
///   rule the ↺ disc and the pill's label already follow); a mark on artwork only describes.
///
/// **`InProgress` outranks the watched flag**, exactly as the poster's does: PMS reports both on a
/// finished-then-restarted item, and being part-way through the re-watch is what the viewer is
/// doing. Pure, so the control set it produces is host-gradeable.
///
/// **The tile context menu asks the same question and must give the same answer** — its state rows
/// are this vocabulary as words (`ui::item_menu::state_rows`), so a change to what counts as "in
/// the middle" here belongs in `widgets::row_watch_state` too, which is that menu's resolver over a
/// catalog row and departs from `poster_mark` on exactly the container case this one does.
///
/// **KNOWN, on CONTAINERS only: the optimistic flip does not reach the evidence this reads**, so a
/// show's tail settles a round trip late instead of on the press frame. `metadata::set_watched_local`
/// edits the matched item's own `watched`/`resume_ms` — which is the whole answer for a leaf — but a
/// show's progress lives in `on_deck` and the seasons' `viewed_leaf_count`, and those keep the
/// server's pre-press values until `refresh_view_state`'s re-read lands. Marking a show watched
/// therefore changes nothing on screen for that window, and un-watching a finished one shows the
/// ✓ face on it for a beat before settling to −. Self-correcting, and no verb is wrong while it
/// lasts — the toggle is offering the write the server still believes is available.
/// Fixing it means teaching that function to carry a container's evidence too

/// disappears when the item is watched because there is then no resume point left. The pair the row
/// used to grow was that fact stated twice, once in the wrong vocabulary.
///
/// **The tile context menu still offers BOTH rows and is right to** (`item_menu::state_rows`). A

/// at once; a toggle is one control that must read as the thing it currently is. Same
/// [`hero_watch_state`] vocabulary underneath, two presentations of it — which is why the menu was

///
/// One further consequence, and it is what keeps the row honest: the toggle is the control that can

    // under the pills but the focused pill's own face. It is the top tab bar's pills that must not
    // scale, because a track encloses them, and the rule was carried across to a row the design
    // system had deliberately exempted. `widgets::CTRL_FOCUS_SCALE` had said the bare pills "do pop"
    // for months while nothing in the draw scaled anything, which is how the divergence survived.
