//! **"What goes on your Home?"** — the first-run route, `Shared Sources.dc.html` deliverable F.
//!
//! One question, asked once, after the profile picker and before Home: which of the libraries this
//! account can reach should merge into the front door. Your own arrive **On**; a friend's arrive
//! **Off**, because the point of asking is not to put a stranger's shelves on your Home unannounced.
//! Nothing here grants or blocks access — every library listed is browsable from the Library chip
//! either way, which is what makes skipping a real answer rather than a deferral.
//!
//! ## It is a ROUTE, not a sheet
//!
//! The same standing as sign-in and the who's-watching picker: it has a beginning and an end and
//! never comes back. That is what the app's no-full-screen-sheets rule protects — a sheet claims
//! there is a screen behind it, and there is not one here — so the rows sit directly on the shared
//! frozen route ground with no panel, shadow or radius. The ground takes Home's UltraBlur envelope
//! once; it is atmosphere, not a second navigable screen behind this one.
//!
//! ## The list is A's, not a second expression of it
//!
//! [`crate::ui::source_list`] builds it, exactly as the Library toolbar's Source panel does — same
//! groups, same rows, same marks, same "Home needs one library" refusal. The two differences are
//! stated as arguments and not as a second builder: this one lists EVERY library rather than the
//! browsed type's (`browse::all_source_rows` — there is no tab bar here to be scoped to), and it
//! carries no *Check for new shares* row, because a share arriving later must not reopen a
//! first-run screen.
//!
//! ## BACK is navigation, never an answer
//!
//! `Start watching` is the only first-run commit, and Settings mode's `Done` is its exact twin —
//! between mount and one of those two, every toggle edits a local DRAFT (`DRAFT` below) and nothing
//! else. [`toggle_selected`] never calls `browse::toggle_pin`: that function both mutates the LIVE
//! section table and records it (`record_pins(true)` — "a profile that has flipped a switch has
//! plainly been asked"), so a screen that called it on every press had already answered the
//! first-run question the instant a first row was touched, whichever way BACK was then pressed.
//! [`commit`] is the only place `browse::apply_pins` is called, which is what makes BACK/Cancel free
//! to be a pure discard — there is nothing on disk to undo, because nothing was written until this
//! screen said so explicitly. Before a real library lands the action retries discovery and still
//! cannot persist an empty answer.
