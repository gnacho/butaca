//! **About** — the detail page's About footer, read in full, as a glass alert panel.
//!
//! `Alert Views.dc.html` §1A. The About footer (detail section 5) is four columns; only the FIRST
//! one, the card, opens THIS panel. That is the design's rule and it is stated as a rule rather
//! than as a layout accident: *"a block earns an alert only when the page truncates something
//! worth reading in full."* The card truncates — its synopsis is capped at five `CAPTION` lines
//! with a right-pinned MORE. The other three do not, and each is settled by name:
//!
//! * **Accessibility** is three fixed definitions of CC/SDH/AD that never change and are already
//!   printed in full on the page — no alert.
//! * **Information** is *"four facts the detail screen already prints in full behind the panel, so
//!   they stay there"* — no alert, and (see below) no copy of them in this one either.
//! * **Languages** — the audio list — *"belongs beside the bitrates in Track information"* (§1B),
//!   so that column opens §1B rather than a panel of its own. `crate::ui::tracks_panel`.
//!
//! Do not give columns 1 or 3 an alert from this note. The absence is the design.
//!
//! # It holds the PROSE and nothing else, and that is a correction
//!
//! This panel shipped with a title, a genre line and a four-column facts grid under the synopsis,
//! on the earlier spec's reasoning that the Information facts *"ride along"* here rather than earn
//! a panel. **Both halves were wrong on screen and the design now says so.** The facts sat in the
//! panel while the page printed the same four, in the same order, in the Information column
//! *directly behind it* — visible around the panel's own edge, which is how the duplication was
//! spotted. The title and genres repeated the card the press came from, on the frame that card is
//! still showing them.
//!
//! So §1A is now: eyebrow, synopsis, tagline, hairline, footer. Everything the reader came for and
//! nothing they are already looking at. [`Blocks`] and [`Stack`] carry exactly those.
//!
//! # What it is made of
//!
//! One [`Popover`] on the shared open/appear choreography, one glass ground, and a fixed vertical
//! ladder of runs — no list, no focus, no control. The only key it answers is BACK (and OK, see
//! [`on_ok`]), because §1E states the family rule: *"only 1D carries a control — the read-only
//! panels close on BACK."* So the closing `Press [BACK] to return` line is not a hint, it is the
//! whole affordance, and it is the shared [`crate::ui::widgets::KeyHint`].
//!
//! # Two things about it that are decisions rather than defaults
//!
//! **The height is CONTENT-DRIVEN.** The mock hints 1120×360; that is a canvas placeholder and the
//! content div under it carries no height at all. A real PMS synopsis runs well past three lines,
//! and the whole reason this panel exists is that the card CUT one — so a panel that cut it again
//! at a different width would be pointless. The panel grows, and [`syn_lines`] is the last resort:
//! it spends whatever is left inside the screen's glass keep-out and never less than one line.
//!
//! **It is the only glass on its frame, and it charges past the region budget.** Stated rather than
//! hidden, in the design's own words: every one of these panels does, once grown 88px a side — and
//! that is accepted because [`crate::gfx::GLASS_REGION_BUDGET`] prices a MOVING host, while the page
//! under an open alert is standing still. The detail page behind this one is not scrolling, its
//! shelves are not springing and its hero is not advancing: nothing under the panel changes, so the
//! one cached snapshot [`crate::ui::widgets::Glass::CACHED`] takes on open stays true for as long as
//! the panel is up. A panel over a moving page would owe `Glass::DYNAMIC_BACKDROP` and a real
//! per-frame cost; this one owes one capture. It also clears the design's `--glass-edge-clear` 68 on
//! all four sides ([`EDGE_CLEAR`]), which is what keeps the blur's own sample window on the page
//! rather than off the edge of it.
