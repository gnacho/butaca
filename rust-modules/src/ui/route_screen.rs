//! Shared full-screen route geometry used by Settings and its children.
//!
//! A route screen is a two-column composition, not a bag of coordinates: a narrative column on
//! the left, a content column on the right, and one bottom action row. Screens supply words and
//! state; this module owns every spatial relationship between them.
//!
//! # Where BACK goes is the CRUMB, never a hint in the action band
//!
//! A route in this family that was arrived at from somewhere says so on one caption line above
//! its title: a left-pointing chevron and the name of the place BACK returns to (see
//! [`RouteLayout::draw_narrative`]). That line replaced the `Press [BACK] to return` hint this
//! family used to draw in the bottom action row, and the trade is the point rather than a tidy-up
//! — the hint spent a whole 60px band restating a key the remote already has, and it could not
//! say where the key WENT, which on a three-deep push (Settings → Legal notices → a document) is
//! the only part anybody needs. Freeing the band is what lets first-run consent put its two
//! answers there ([`RouteLayout::action_pair`]) instead of hiding them among the readable rows of
//! its list.
//!
//! **The rule for `None` is "BACK does not go anywhere inside the app", not "the Settings root".**
//! Three routes qualify today and a hard count here would be the fourth transcription of a number
//! this project keeps letting rot — take the census with
//! `git grep -A2 'draw_narrative(' -- 'rust-modules/src/ui/*.rs'`. They are the Settings modal
//! (BACK leaves the family), the FIRST first-run consent question (sign-in is behind it and
//! cannot be undone) and the QR sign-in itself (there is no app behind it yet).
//!
//! # ONE focus model for the whole family
//!
//! Every screen here is the same two regions: the **content column** on the right (a table of
//! rows, or a document), and the **action band** at the bottom of the left column (0, 1 or 2
//! controls). [`RouteFocus`] holds where focus is and [`RouteShape`] is what a screen tells it
//! about itself this frame; the rules below are pure, live here, and every screen in the family
//! obeys all of them. They exist because the family had drifted into five different answers —
//! Legal entered on RIGHT and left on LEFT while the Settings root ignored both; the Home editor
//! reached its Done pill only with LEFT; Privacy & data jumped focus onto Done after a toggle and
//! then had no way back; and first-run consent's two answers could not be left rightward at all.
//!
//! 1. **UP/DOWN walk the content column.** A table moves its selection; a document scrolls.
//! 2. **DOWN off the LAST row enters the band**, on the control the band's cursor last rested on.
//! 3. **UP leaves the band for the content column**, on the row it left from — so 2 and 3 are an
//!    exact round trip.
//! 4. **DOWN on the band is the floor.** The band is the bottom of the screen; there is nothing
//!    under it.
//! 5. **LEFT from the content column enters the band**, on the same remembered control as rule 2.
//!    (The band sits in the LEFT column, so this is the spatial move, not a shortcut.)
//! 6. **LEFT inside the band steps to the control on its left.**
//! 7. **RIGHT inside the band steps to the control on its right; from the trailing control it
//!    returns to the content column** — the inverse of rule 5.
//! 8. **RIGHT on a row that opens nested content (a chevron row) enters it**, exactly as OK does.
//!    RIGHT on any other row does nothing.
//! 9. **LEFT is BACK once there is nothing further to its left, UNLESS the screen is holding an
//!    uncommitted edit** ([`RouteShape::uncommitted`]). This is what makes the crumb literal — it
//!    is drawn as a left-pointing chevron naming where BACK goes, and LEFT follows it. The
//!    exception is the one thing a directional key must never do: BACK on these screens DISCARDS
//!    (Privacy & data drops its draft, the Home editor drops its — nothing was written), and
//!    overshooting the band's leading control by one press is not consent to lose an edit.
//!    **`uncommitted` is stated by the screen and is NOT "the screen has a band".** That inference
//!    was this rule's first justification and it is false in both directions: the Home editor's
//!    `Try again` is a band with no edit behind it, and first run's two answers are a band whose
//!    BACK records nothing. So Settings-mode Retry and first-run consent both let LEFT follow
//!    their crumb, while a dirty draft does not.
//! 10. **Focus can never rest on nothing.** [`RouteFocus::settle`] runs after every rebuild: a band
//!    that has gone away hands focus back to the content column, and a content column with no rows
//!    hands it to the band. Privacy & data used to lose focus entirely by toggling a value back —
//!    it parked focus on a Done that the same edit had just removed.
//! 11. **The pointer PARKS focus and nothing else.** Hover moves focus to the row or band control
//!    under the pointer on every screen in the family ([`ActionRow::hit`] +
//!    [`crate::ui::table::TableView::hit_row`]); a click activates whatever is parked; a click that
//!    parks nothing does nothing.
