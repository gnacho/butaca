//! **The Sources ROW MODEL** — one list of libraries grouped by server, drawn on two surfaces.
//!
//! The Library toolbar's Source panel (`ui::library`, deliverable A) and the first-run route that
//! asks the same question before Home (`ui::onboard`, deliverable F) show the SAME list: your
//! servers, each server's libraries, and whether each one feeds Home. The canvas says so in as
//! many words — F "is the same list as A's On Home level, in the flow's own frame rather than a
//! panel" — so it is one builder, and the two screens differ only in the frame around it and in
//! whether the roster-refresh row rides along.
//!
//! Building it twice would have been the ordinary thing to do and the wrong one: the two would
//! have drifted on exactly the details that make the list readable — which column carries a mark,
//! which carries a word, what an unreachable group says and where it says it — and each drift
//! would read as a bug on whichever screen you saw second.
//!
//! Pure over its inputs, so it is host-testable without a live section table (which is also why
//! `browse` hands out owned [`SrcGroup`](crate::browse::SrcGroup)/[`SrcRow`](crate::browse::SrcRow)
//! projections rather than borrows of its statics).
