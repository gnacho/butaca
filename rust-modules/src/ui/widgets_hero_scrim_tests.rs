//
// All pure math over `theme` tokens and the two screens' own layout arithmetic — no GL, no
// globals, so these are ordinary parallel tests. The screens' contributions come from
// `ui::landing_hero::base_scrim_a` / `detail::base_scrim_a` / `detail::hero_chain`, which is the whole
// point of those three being pure: the contract below reads the SAME numbers the draw does.

/// The bilinear field a `(rect, [tl, tr, br, bl])` quad actually rasterizes, at absolute
/// `(x, y)` — the shader's own `mix(mix(tl,tr,u), mix(bl,br,u), v)`, in alpha. The anti-drift
/// yardstick: the closed-form [`hero_scrim_a`]/[`hero_scrim_right_a`] the contract is graded on
/// and the corner colours that are actually drawn must agree, or the promise is about a field
/// nobody paints.
