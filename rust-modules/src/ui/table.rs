//! ui/table.rs — a reusable, animated list/table widget (Apple-TV "settings" look).
//!
//! A single selectable list built from `Section`s of `Row`s. The focused row is drawn as a
//! light rounded "pill" that SLIDES between rows (a spring on its y), rows scroll with a spring
//! when they overflow the frame, and everything is drawn through a `Painter` so the owner can
//! fade/translate the whole thing in (the open animation). It knows nothing about playback or
//! metadata: the caller builds the sections, drives selection, and reads `sel` back — so the
//! same widget serves the in-player track menu and the Settings, Privacy and Legal surfaces.
