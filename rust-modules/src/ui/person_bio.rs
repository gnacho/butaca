//! The person page's **bio alert panel** — the full biography, behind the truncation mark.
//!
//! **The reference is `Alert Views.dc.html` §1C · Person** (the owner's design project): a centred
//! 1120×700 glass sheet with 48px of padding and a [`theme::ALERT_PANEL_RAD`] corner, holding an
//! eyebrow, the name, an identity line, and — between two hairlines — the biography as a
//! **scrolling, paged viewport** with a feathered edge and a rail down its right side. The footer
//! states what the page knows about this person's presence in the library, and how to leave.
//!
//! **It is the panel BEHIND the mark, not a replacement for it.** `person.rs`'s bio block dissolves
//! its third line into a right-pinned `MORE` (`TextView::fade_last` + the pinned label), and that
//! affordance is unchanged: `MORE` is still a mark rather than a control, still unfocusable, still
//! drawn only when `bio.truncates(BIO_W)`. This panel is what OK on the header now opens, and it is
//! gated on **exactly that same predicate** — [`person::bio_is_truncated`]. A panel that opened on a
//! two-line bio would show the reader the words they had just finished reading.
//!
//! ## Three things here are not obvious
//!
//! **1. The scrim belongs to the PAGE, and it is heavier than a menu's.** [`scrim`] is called from
//! `person::draw` before the panel, not from [`draw`] — the rule `Popover::scrim` states for a
//! refreshing backdrop, kept here because it is also what makes the *contrast* argument work. The
//! design's host frame carries a standing comment that nothing bright may sit inside the panel's own
//! rectangle: a 72px name read through a 72% frost lifts the ground under the fine print past its
//! graded contrast. On the real page that name is not hypothetical — `person.rs` draws the person's
//! own name at `size::HERO` at x≈474, y≈96, which is *directly behind this panel's top-left corner*,
//! where the eyebrow and the identity line sit. The mock could stage that away; we cannot, so the
//! page is dimmed at [`SCRIM_A`] — [`theme::SCRIM_TEXT_A`], the measured text-legibility floor —
//! before the frost ever samples it. The anchored chip menus use 0.45 because nothing of theirs is
//! fine print over a headline; this panel's whole lower half is.
//!
//! **2. Paragraphs are separate views, because `TextView` cannot hold them.** `TextView::wrap`
//! splits on `char::is_whitespace` and reflows the lot, so a `\n\n` in a plex.tv biography is
//! destroyed — every paragraph break in the source becomes a single space. The block is therefore
//! [`paragraphs`] + one memoised `TextView` each, stacked on [`PARA_GAP`]. That also buys the
//! per-paragraph cull for free.
//!
//! **3. Nothing here animates from a clock.** The scroll is a [`Spring`], so `gfx::spring` reports
//! it to [`crate::ui::idle`] and the present gate sees the paging motion without this module opting
//! in. That is deliberate rather than incidental — `Xfade` and `Spinner` both shipped FROZEN behind
//! that gate because they integrate milliseconds, and a hand-rolled scroll offset here would have
//! been the third. The discrete transitions ([`open`]/[`close`]/[`move_focus`]) still call
//! `idle::invalidate` because a state change is not motion.
//!
//! **4. The panel's own paging must not re-source its own backdrop, and that took a measured FPS
//! regression to notice.** Every `move_focus` page turn calls `idle::invalidate` (point 3), which
//! is exactly right for the present gate — a page turn is real content damage and has to present.
//! It is exactly WRONG for [`prepare_present`]'s `underlay_changed` argument, though: `app.rs`'s
//! route arm hands it `underlay_moving || idle::present_dirty()`, and `present_dirty` cannot tell
//! "the PAGE BEHIND this panel changed" from "this panel's own page-turn just fired the very
//! `invalidate` point 3 documents" — both set the same process-wide flag. Taken straight through,
//! every keypress re-sources the WHOLE host page into the blur target and re-blurs it, although
//! nothing under the panel moved at all: the person page's header and shelves sit exactly still
//! while the reader pages the biography. [`prepare_present`] therefore does not trust the caller's
//! flag alone — it ALSO asks this panel's own [`Popover::appear_settled`], and refreshes only while
//! the appear choreography is still ramping (where a stale backdrop under a mid-fade scrim is the
//! contrast bug point 1 exists to prevent) or the caller's flag is true for some OTHER reason (a
//! shelf landing or a poster texture arriving on the person page itself, which does redraw the
//! header/shelves this panel sits over — `person::update` keeps pumping under an open panel, and
//! the media fetch is independent of the profile fetch that made the panel openable, so this is
//! the ordinary case on a cold page, not a corner). The panel therefore needs a ledger of the
//! damage it caused this frame — a page turn, or its scroll spring still gliding — subtracted from
//! the caller's flag.
//!
//! **That ledger and that decision are SHARED now** (2026-09-02). They lived here as a private
//! `OWN_DAMAGE` static and a private `glass_refresh`, because this was the first panel whose frame
//! rate was measured; the bug is a property of every popover with a scroll or a selection in it.
//! They are `popover::note_own_damage` / `popover::own_motion` and `popover::glass_refresh`, and
//! `Popover::prepare_present` folds them in itself — so this module's `prepare_present` is now a
//! plain forward, and the panels that never had the fix have it. The decision is unchanged and so
//! is its test, which moved to `popover.rs` with the function it grades.
