// The FADE variant is a SEPARATE program bound only by draw_text_fade (callers: TextView::fade_last
// - the About card's and person header's MORE dissolve - and TextView::edge_fade - a scrolling
// viewport's clipped edge, `screens::person_bio`'s bio panel): u_tfade = (from, to) in string-texture
// uv.x fades the glyph HORIZONTALLY; u_vfadeT / u_vfadeB = (from, to) in ABSOLUTE LOGICAL SCREEN Y
// fade it VERTICALLY, ramping 0->1 rising through the top band and 1->0 falling through the bottom
// one. Each band is a uniform pair rather than a bespoke uniform per caller so the three fades can
// combine (a line that is both the truncated last one AND crossing a viewport edge dissolves on
// both axes at once). All three are OFF by default ((0,0), since the gate is `to > from`) and an
// off band costs one scalar compare, not a texture sample — kept off fs_text.frag so every ordinary
// glyph on this fill-rate-bound panel doesn't pay for any of it.
