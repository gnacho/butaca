// The GLASS panel backdrop: the blurred snapshot sampled through a rounded slab that REFRACTS at
// its edges, so a popover reads as a thick object over the page rather than as a flat frosted
// rectangle. Apple's Liquid Glass is the reference for the behaviour, not for any implementation.
//
// It is nearly free, and the reason is that the LENS IS THE SDF WE ALREADY COMPUTE. `fs_img.frag`
// and `fs_src.frag` evaluate `sdBox` for every panel fragment to round its corners and antialias
// its edge; the distance that falls out of that is exactly the "how deep into the bevel am I"
// term a refraction needs, and the gradient of the same field is the surface normal to bend along.
// So the whole effect is a perturbed texture coordinate: NO extra pass, NO extra render target,
// and in the interior not even an extra fetch, because the early-out below returns before any of
// it runs.
//
// Three parts, in the order they matter:
//
//   1. **The lens.** `t` ramps 0→1 across `u_bevel` px inward from the edge, squared so the bend
//      is concentrated at the rim the way a real chamfer concentrates it. The UV is pushed OUTWARD
//      along the normal, which pulls what lies just beyond the panel into its rim. The displacement
//      is large on purpose: a blurred field has only coarse structure left, so a small offset moves
//      nothing the eye can see, and the effect has to come from sliding whole light and dark
//      regions rather than from any detail inside them.
//   2. **A DIRECTIONAL edge light.** Not a uniform ring: a slab lit from above has a bright top
//      chamfer and a dark bottom one, and that asymmetry is most of what says "this is a solid
//      object at an angle" rather than "this is a rectangle with a glow". `dot(normal, u_light.xy)`
//      — the normal is already in hand for the lens — lights the facing side and shades the other
//      by `u_light.z`.
//   3. **Dither** — `dither.glsl` since 2026-09-02, and BOTH of this shader's dither defects were
//      the reason that file exists. It carried its own `fract(sin(dot(p,k))*43758.5)` hash, which is
//      (a) structured — a sine hash on this part repeats and beats against the panel grid, which is
//      the "strange patterns" this surface was reported for — and (b) UNCONDITIONAL, evaluated on
//      every fragment of every glass surface whether or not the amplitude was non-zero. That is the
//      exact mistake `fs_ambient.frag`'s COST note records having made and fixed, priced there at
//      38% of a Home frame, and this program never got the fix. It is one `texture2D` and one add
//      now, straight-line (`dither.glsl` cost rule 1). The old note, still true of WHY a dither is wanted here:
//      A blurred field is nearly a gradient, and a gradient in 8 bits BANDS — the more
//      so where the lens stretches it. `GL_DITHER` is off on this part and `ui/widgets.rs` already
//      abandoned one construction over the same staircase, so the noise is not optional polish. It
//      is ±half a quantum, below the threshold of being seen as grain and above the one that turns
//      a band into a dither.
//
// **A REJECTED fourth part, recorded because it is the obvious idea and it is wrong.** The first
// version mixed the rim toward a SHARPER level of the chain (the half-res one, already allocated
// and otherwise idle), reasoning that real glass compresses the background at its edge rather than
// dissolving it, and that a quarter-res blur has nothing left to compress. Built and looked at on
// the television: it reads as the panel being **thinner at the edge**, not as refraction. Clarity
// is how a material says how much of it there is — changing it across the panel says the glass
// tapers, which is not what a bevel does. It also left a visible seam wherever the sharp and
// blurred levels disagreed, i.e. on exactly the high-contrast edges the effect was meant to show
// off. The material's opacity is uniform now, and only the GEOMETRY varies. That also gave the
// renderer its second texture unit back.
//
// PRECISION: every coordinate chain is highp, for the reason fs_src.frag's note spells out — fp16
// on a card-sized quad is off by ~half a texel, and here that error IS the refraction offset, so a
// mediump lens would ripple along a straight edge instead of bending evenly.

// THE RIM'S SECOND SOURCE — the page, unblurred, sampled through the SAME displacement.
//
// The lens compresses `[edge, edge + lens]` into `[edge, edge + bevel]`, which is a real
// compression and reads as nothing at all when both sides of the boundary are already mush: a
// squeezed average of a blur is a blur. Measured on the television — raising the displacement from
// 24 to 200 does not bend anything, it just thickens a dark ring, because there is no structure
// left in the source to move. The reference bends RECOGNISABLE content: what is immediately
// outside the container, squeezed into a narrow band at its edge, still sharp enough to be read as
// the same thing.
//
// So the band mixes toward the full-resolution grab the chain already holds (`BlurChain::grab`),
// with the same offset, weighted by `t` so the mix is zero where the band meets the interior and
// there is no seam to see. `u_sharpw = 0` restores the single-source material exactly.
//
// NB this is NOT the rejected experiment recorded below. That one varied CLARITY across the panel

// is beside it while the middle of the same object stays neutral.
//
// Ours did not, and over a bright hero it could not: the density solve puts the scrim as high as
// .72, and a uniform .72 means the beautifully refracted band at the rim is 72% flat black by the
// time anything sees it. The reference makes the point unmissable — a red caption directly above
// iOS's tab bar leaves a red cast IN the bar's bright top edge, several pixels of it, while the
// bar's middle over the same page stays grey.
//
// Zero restores the uniform scrim exactly. It ramps with `t`, not `t*t`, so it reaches the
// interior early-out's full-strength scrim continuously — the two exits of this shader must agree
// at `t = 0` or the bevel's inner boundary draws itself as a step.

// and through the context menu directly above it almost nothing is. A menu is a surface you read
// and act on; a bar is chrome you look past.
//
// Rather than a second chain (another pair of targets and another set of passes, for a surface that

// the texture across and `1/SCR_H` down, so on a 16:9 canvas that squashed the sample cross to
