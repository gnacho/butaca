// The SDF rounded-rect FILL: vertical gradient fill + per-corner-side radius (u_radius left /
// u_radR right) + the focus ring/glow, with a flat fast-path for radius-0 non-focus rects
// (full-screen scrims/backdrops pay one mix, no SDF). Also carries the focus edge-sheen
// (u_rimw/u_rimcol, additive like the focus ring) so a rounded FILL can draw the 1px perimeter
// stroke in its own pass - same fold as fs_img.frag, for the skeleton/chip tiles that have no
// texture. Disabled by u_rimcol.a == 0 (the default from draw_rect/draw_rrect).
//
// PRECISION (this file, fs_shadow.frag, fs_img.frag - and the texture UVs in fs_text*.frag): the
// varying + every op that carries pixel COORDINATES must be `highp`. Midgard interpolates mediump
// varyings in fp16, whose error grows with quad size - on card-sized quads it wobbles the SDF
// distance by ~0.1-0.5px along a straight edge, dashing the 1px AA/rim rows into a "ribbed" edge
// (deterministic, worst on the resume bar's full-card quad; verified on-device by pixel-diffing
// captures). Texture coordinates on wide 1:1 quads need it too: fp16 v_cuv is ~1 texel off at the
// right of a 1920px backdrop (GL_LINEAR then blurs/skips texel columns). The color path stays
// mediump, and the stored `d` may drop back to mediump (fp16 is exact near 0; the cancellation
// happens inside the highp sdBox). vy is a deliberate mediump copy so the flat fast-path's mix
// stays fp16.
