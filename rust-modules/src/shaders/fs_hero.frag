// THE HERO GROUND IN ONE PASS: the backdrop photograph with both scrim fields applied to it
// analytically, instead of the photograph plus four blended quads drawn over it.
//
// The measured reason (dev television, Mali-T820, Home's hero with the per-draw-class overdraw
// ledger armed):
// the hero submits 5.39M authored pixels a frame against a 2.07M-pixel panel — 2.60x — and 90% of
// that is three stacked full-panel layers. The art is 2,073,600 px; the frame-wide atmospheric ramp
// is two quads totalling 1,368,576; the corner wedge is two more totalling 1,410,048. The ramp and
// the wedge are pure GRADIENT: no texture, ~3 ALU each. Their whole cost is that they are 2.78M
// more fragments through the blender, and every one of them lands on a pixel the art already wrote.
//
// Both fields are cheap CLOSED FORMS of the authored pixel position, and both are the same ink
// (theme::SCRIM_INK) at different weights. So this shader evaluates both where the art already is:
//
//   a1  the atmospheric ramp — two linear segments meeting at a knee (home::base_scrim_a)
//   a2  the corner wedge — hero_scrim_a(x) feathered in over [top, knee] (widgets::hero_scrim_quads)
//
// Two straight-alpha layers of ONE ink compose exactly as a1 + a2 - a1*a2, so B below is what the
// two of them together do to whatever is under them. The art itself may be translucent (it fades
// with the snap dive), and the result must still be one draw over the ground the frame already
// holds, so the emitted fragment is the ALGEBRAIC composite of all three:
//
//   want   dst' = mix(mix(dst, art, A), ink, B)
//               = dst*(1-A)*(1-B) + art*A*(1-B) + ink*B
//   one straight-alpha blend gives dst*(1-s) + src*s, so
//   s      = 1 - (1-A)*(1-B)
//   src    = (art*A*(1-B) + ink*B) / s
//
// which is exact in real arithmetic. What differs from the four-quad path is 8-bit ROUNDING: that
// path quantises the framebuffer three times where this quantises once, so the two can disagree by
// a code or two inside the ramps. The pixel diff in `docs/backdrop-blur-profiling.md` is the
// measurement, not a promise.
//
// Pairs with vs_img.vert, which already hands over v_cuv and v_p (quad-local pixels). u_org is the
// quad's CENTRE in authored pixels, so v_p + u_org is the screen position both fields are defined
// in — the art quad is a `Rect::cover`, so it is not the panel and its own UV cannot stand in.
// v_p/u_org are highp for the same reason fs_src.frag's coordinate chain is: an fp16 difference of
// two ~1000px numbers is a third of a pixel, and these ramps run over hundreds of them.
