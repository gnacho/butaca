//! **The one door out of the control plane** — the single place that decides which transport a
//! Plex REST request takes, and the only place that knows there is more than one.
//!
//! ## Why this file exists
//!
//! The control plane has two request transports and they are not interchangeable:
//!
//! * [`crate::stream`] is a raw TCP socket. It resolves through `getaddrinfo` and dials either
//!   address family, it is fast, and it speaks **cleartext only**.
//! * [`crate::net`] is libcurl. It also validates certificates, and it is what plex.tv has always
//!   been reached through.
//!
//! Media makes its own scheme decision under `ff.rs`: the same `stream.rs` socket for plaintext,
//! or [`crate::curlio`]'s interruptible libcurl-multi pull source for HTTPS. That is deliberately
//! outside this REST request façade.
//!
//! **TLS is now the only thing that separates them**, which `stream.rs`'s own module doc says in
//! those words. Until this file, the PMS control plane was hard-wired to the first of the two, and
//! that is the whole of why a reviewer with no Plex Media Server on their LAN dead-ends: an account
//! signed in from anywhere else reaches its servers over `https://<something>.plex.direct` — a name
//! carrying a certificate, and cleartext to the address behind it fails validation by design
//! (`plex::origin`).
//!
//! So the dispatch is on [`Origin::scheme`] and nowhere else. An [`Origin`] is parsed from a URL
//! and never rebuilt from an address, so by the time a request reaches here the question "which
//! transport" has exactly one answer and no call site has to know it.
//!
//! ## What it returns, and why that is the interesting half
//!
//! [`Reply`] carries the **status and the body**, always.
//!
//! `stream.rs` used to offer three one-shot wrappers — `http_get`, `http_put`, `http_post` — and
//! each folded away half the answer: the first two returned `Option<Vec<u8>>`, collapsing every
//! non-2xx into the same `None` a refused connection produces, and the third returned the status
//! with the body dropped. That collapse is precisely the bug [`crate::plex::probe::Outcome`] exists
//! to prevent: a final `401` after the parallel direct and relay candidates settle is a TOKEN or
//! access-policy problem, while a refusal is a REACHABILITY problem, and reporting the first as
//! the second sends a user to look at their friend's router. `auth::get_identity` had already had
//! to hand-roll its own
//! open/read/close to keep the two apart; it calls this instead now, and gets the same answer over
//! either transport. The three wrappers had no other callers and went with the change.
//!
//! Callers that genuinely want the fold still write it — `plex::client`'s read choke points check
//! [`Reply::ok`] — but they write it, rather than inheriting it from a transport.
//!
//! ## Two asymmetries worth knowing before you read a failure
//!
//! **Deadlines.** Small API calls take [`net::API`] (8 s connect, 25 s total). Content-dependent
//! PMS reads take [`net::BULK`] instead: the same connect setting, a 1-byte/s-for-30-s low-speed
//! guard, and no whole-transfer timeout, so a healthy large library/art/subtitle response is not
//! cut off at 25 s while a stalled body is still bounded. The connect value is not a promise over
//! a synchronous resolver when `NOSIGNAL` is set; `net::global_init` logs the runtime's
//! `AsynchDNS` feature bit. The plaintext arm cannot select either policy: `stream.rs` compiles in
//! its own 2 s connect and 15 s `SO_RCVTIMEO`.
//!
//! **Redirects.** The plaintext transport returns a 3xx response and never follows it. The TLS
//! arm does the same for PMS requests. This is a correctness rule and a credential boundary:
//! every PMS path carries `X-Plex-Token` in its query string, so an automatic cross-origin follow
//! would give libcurl permission to replay a token-bearing URL outside the origin we selected and
//! verified. The plex.tv account wrappers also keep redirects off because their custom headers
//! carry a token. Only the public, headerless QR-image fetch may follow one: at most five hops,
//! HTTP(S) only, and never from HTTPS down to HTTP.
//!
//! **A short body is reported on one arm only.** `stream.rs` logs a line when a response ends
//! before its `Content-Length` (`note_short_body` — the difference between "the JSON would not
//! parse" and "the server never answered"), and the plaintext arm below calls it; the TLS arm
//! cannot, because libcurl owns that framing and `net.rs` sees only the assembled body. The gap is
//! narrower than it looks: `plex::client::get_json` logs the status, the byte count and serde's own
//! error whenever a 2xx will not parse, over either transport.
