//! **The crash channel, and the guarantee that it carries no text.**
//!
//! Reads the append-only crash log the C tracer writes (`src/crashtrace.c`), turns each fault
//! record into a Sentry event, and reports it on the next launch — because the process that wrote
//! it no longer exists, which is the whole reason the log is on disk and not in memory.
//!
//! # NOTHING FROM THE LOG'S TEXT REACHES THE WIRE
//!
//! This is a decision, taken deliberately after the alternative was considered and rejected: the
//! app does not send its logs, and the crash channel does not carry breadcrumbs, messages, or any
//! string lifted out of a file.
//!
//! It is enforced structurally rather than by care. [`parse`] reads **numbers only** — the signal
//! number, `addr`, `pc`, `lr`, and the registers — and the signal's NAME is then derived from
//! [`signal_name`], a fixed table in this file. So even the one human-readable token in the record
//! (`SIGSEGV`) reaches Sentry as a `&'static str` this crate owns, not as bytes that happened to be
//! in a file. A tracer that one day wrote something unexpected there could not smuggle it out.
//!
//! The same rule kills the obvious shortcut of shipping the record verbatim as the exception
//! `value`. That would be one line of code, would look identical in the Sentry UI, and would make
//! the whole guarantee a matter of what the tracer happens to write.
//!
//! # The panic message is the sharp edge, and it is not sent
//!
//! The plan this was built to flagged an inversion worth restating: an allowlist that guards
//! breadcrumbs while the *exception message* is free-text panic payload protects the cheap channel
//! and leaves the expensive one open. A Rust panic message routinely carries a path, a URL, or an
//! interpolated value — `unwrap()` on a `Result<_, io::Error>` prints the filename.
//!
//! So [`PanicReport`] carries the **location** (`file:line`, a `&'static str` baked into the binary
//! at compile time, and therefore source text rather than anybody's data) and a **hash** of the
//! message. The hash still groups identical panics into one Sentry issue, which is most of what the
//! message was for; the text itself never leaves. `docs/…` aside, the practical consequence is that
//! a panic tells you WHERE and HOW OFTEN, and you read WHAT in the log on the television.
//!
//! # Sending twice is worse than not sending
//!
//! `plxnative-crash.log` is append-only and survives relaunch **by design** — `docs/agent-reference.md` calls it the
//! thing to read after a crash-and-restart, and `tools/crash-report.sh` parses it. So this module
//! may not truncate it. Instead it records how many bytes it has already reported and skips them,
//! which means a human and this module can both read the file without either disturbing the other.

/// The one place a signal number becomes a name. See the module doc: this exists so the name on the
