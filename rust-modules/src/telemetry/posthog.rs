//! **The PostHog capture body, hand-rolled** — the pure half: two endpoint shapes, one privacy flag.
//!
//! Like [`super::sentry`], everything here is a function from values to bytes. No socket, no
//! endpoint, no key. What it exists to get right is two things a reader would reasonably assume are
//! the same and are not, plus one flag whose absence is a privacy posture nobody chose.
//!
//! # The two shapes differ in WHERE the identity goes — verified against the vendor docs
//!
//! This was carried into the plan as an externally-sourced claim nobody here had checked. It is
//! true, and the consequence is worse than "a different field order":
//!
//! | | `/i/v0/e/` | `/batch/` |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `api_key` | top level | top level, **once for the whole batch** |
//! | `distinct_id` | **top level** | **inside each entry's `properties`** |
//! | events | one, top level | an array under `batch` |
//!
//! Put `distinct_id` at the top of a batch ENTRY and it is not an error — it is an ordinary
//! property named `distinct_id` that PostHog ignores, so every event in the batch arrives with no
//! identity at all and the ingest still answers 200. That is the failure this module is shaped to
//! make impossible, and [`the_two_endpoints_disagree_about_where_identity_goes`] is where it is
//! pinned.
//!
//! # `$process_person_profile: false`, and why it is not a parameter
//!
//! PostHog's API-captured events are **identified by default**. Without this flag every install
//! gets a person profile — a privacy posture this project did not choose and would have to declare
//! — and the event costs about four times as much against the free tier. So it is not an argument
//! and not a default: [`props`] writes it unconditionally, LAST, so it also wins over anything a
//! caller managed to put under the same key. A test asserts it for every [`DiagEvent`] variant
//! rather than for one sample, because "we remembered on this path" is exactly the shape of claim
//! that turns out to be false on the seventh path.
//!
//! [`DiagEvent`]: crate::diag::schema::DiagEvent
//!
//! # Timestamps belong to the durable event
//!
//! The queue captures Unix milliseconds with the event. This pure serializer converts that stored
//! value to ISO 8601 at send time and reads no clock, so an offline spool cannot move an event into
//! the next launch merely because that is when delivery resumed.
//!
//! # One item here is uncalled, on purpose
//!
//! [`batch`] has none: the worker sends one record at a time, because a spool commit acknowledges
//! by `event_id` and a batch that half-succeeds cannot say which half. It is kept because the two
//! endpoints put `distinct_id` in DIFFERENT places — top level for `/i/v0/e/`, inside `properties`
//! for `/batch/` — which is the trap it exists to have already solved.
//!
//! This header used to say no sender existed at all. It does: [`super::sender`].
