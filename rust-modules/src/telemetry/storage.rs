//! Handled storage errors for Sentry — issue #76: a keymanager3 session that seals but never opens
//! again (`plex::session`'s `LOCKED_RECOVERABLE`/refused-marker shape, `keymanager.rs`'s round-trip
//! proof) needs a bounded storage-specific diagnostic alongside the existing telemetry surfaces.
//! This does not claim that every firmware generation was previously silent: receiver evidence
//! exists for some newer-firmware PostHog runs, while Sentry receipt remains separately unverified
//! here. This is the SAME shape as
//! `telemetry::signin` — a closed handled-error report spooled through the existing Errors/Sentry
//! lane and gated on the SAME standing consent question, so it needs no consent bump of its own for
//! the reporting mechanism, only for the fields it adds (see `consent::POLICY_VERSION`).
//!
//! Every value accepted here is a closed enum or a bare number with no identity of its own — there
//! is no key material, no ciphertext, no plaintext, no file path, and no LS2 payload beyond the
//! numeric `errorCode` a service reply already carries (the same reasoning `signin.rs` relies on for
//! its HTTP status / curl rc). [`SessionStorageClass`] is the one vocabulary this module and
//! `diag::schema::UsageContext`'s `session_storage` field share — a value here means the same thing
//! on a crash report as it does riding along a usage event.
//!
//! **Unlike `signin.rs` this module has only the standing form.** A storage failure has no screen a
//! person is looking at to offer a one-off "Send report" press from, so there is no `send_once`
//! twin — [`report_error_with_candidate_reads`] is the production door, gated on
//! `consent::allows_errors_at(6)`. This whole
//! report — not just one field on it — is Errors scope 6, unlike the playback report (scope 4) and
//! the sign-in report (scope 5), which are each gated at their own, lower scope; the three standing
//! handled-error reports deliberately no longer share one gate.
//!
//! **A report found before that question is answered is HELD, not dropped — issue #76's second
//! half.** A locked read (`plex::session::read_locked`) can land on the very FIRST launch after an
//! update, before the reporting question has been put to anyone at all, or before this report's
//! own scope-6 extension on an already-accepted channel has been ruled on — and the whole point of
//! this report is to describe exactly that shape of failure. [`report_error_with_candidate_reads`] tries
//! [`send_now`] first and, only when that refuses because the question is still open
//! ([`should_defer`]), holds the context in the small in-memory [`DEFERRED`] queue (cap
//! [`DEFERRED_CAP`], session-only — never persisted, so a crash or relaunch before the question is
//! answered loses that queued instance) rather than the old behaviour of dropping it outright.
//! A Keymanager fallback is the narrow exception: its closed, non-secret failure evidence belongs
//! to the persisted ACL envelope, so a later load can recreate the same consent-gated report.
//! [`replay_deferred`],
//! called from `telemetry::record_with_receipt` right after a new decision publishes (same call site as
//! `diag::replay_deferred`, issue #75's twin for the sign-in funnel), sends every held report
//! through [`send_now`] on a "yes" and drops the whole queue with nothing sent on a "no" — either
//! way the queue empties, so a refused answer cannot leak into the next decision. Each held report
//! keeps the timestamp it was ORIGINALLY found at ([`event_body`]'s `occurred_at_ms` argument),
//! not the time the question finally got answered. **A report found before the question is
//! answered is discarded if you answer No, if you SIGN OUT, or if the app closes before you answer
//! at all** — the queue itself is never written to disk. Persisted fallback evidence is still
//! never sent after No. [`forget`] is what keeps deferred state from surviving past the ACCOUNT
//! that found it either (review
//! finding, 2026-09-11: it used to, and the next account's "yes" then sent it under that account's
//! Crash report ID).
