//! **The decision, and the identities that only exist because of it.**
//!
//! Two independent switches — errors and usage — both off until somebody turns them on, plus ONE
//! random identifier PER SWITCH, each minted by that switch's opt-in and destroyed by that switch's
//! withdrawal. Everything in this file is either a pure transition over a [`Consent`] value or the
//! storage under it, so the compliance-critical half is host-tested and needs no television and no
//! vendor.
//!
//! # The three rules that shape it
//!
//! **Nothing is stored to enable telemetry before consent.** Only the decision itself and the
//! policy version it was given against. In particular no identifier: [`apply`] mints one on the
//! transition into a channel's consent, never for the other channel, never at boot or "just in
//! case", and [`no_identifier_exists_before_anyone_says_yes`] is the test that keeps it that way.
//!
//! **Two identifiers, because they are two channels.** The crash-report id (`errors_id`) exists so
//! that Sentry can count how many uninterrupted opt-ins an issue reached rather than how many
//! times it fired — its built-in "users affected" reads exactly `user.id` and nothing else. The
//! analytics id (`install_id`) is PostHog's `distinct_id`. They are never the same value and never
//! travel together: a person who consented to two purposes did not consent to having them joined,
//! and one shared handle is precisely the join. Withdrawing one channel destroys ITS id and leaves
//! the other untouched. **Signing out destroys both and the decision with them**
//! (`telemetry::forget`, behind `auth::forget_account`): consent belongs to the account that gave
//! it, and the next account to sign in is asked afresh.
//!
//! **Two switches, because they are two questions.** Error reports and usage statistics are judged
//! differently by the people who care — when Audacity retreated it dropped usage analytics and kept
//! error reporting — and bundling them into one "analytics?" toggle is the shape that reads as a
//! trick. Two `bool`s, both defaulting to false, and consenting to one says nothing about the other.
//!
//! **Withdrawal DELETES the identifier**, and that is a change from the plan this was built to,
//! forced by a measurement. The plan said keep the id, request deletion from the vendor, and rotate
//! only once that succeeded. Neither vendor can delete anonymous data belonging to no account
//! (`PRIVACY.md` term 7 records why), so "keep it pending a deletion" would be keeping it forever.
//! Dropping it locally is the one thing this app actually controls: it severs any future opt-in
//! from everything sent before, so a person who turns it off and later back on is a new install
//! rather than a resumed profile.
//!
//! # What must NOT happen on the event path
//!
//! [`allows_usage`] is called from `diag::event`, which is reached from the frame loop. It reads a
//! cached snapshot and never touches the disk or a lock. That is not an optimisation — it is the
//! bug this crate already shipped once: wiring the scrubber's identity list to `session::peek()`
//! put five file reads on every log line and deadlocked the whole `auth` test block. The fix there
//! and the design here are the same: the writer PUBLISHES, the hot path reads a snapshot.
//!
//! # The four `#[allow(dead_code)]`s are gone
//!
//! [`POLICY_VERSION`], [`should_ask`], [`apply`] and `telemetry::record` carried one between them,
//! each naming the consent SCREEN as the missing caller. `ui::consent` is that screen, and the
//! attributes were deleted by the commit that added it rather than left behind — which was the
//! stated plan and is worth having actually happened, because a stale allowance is how a genuinely
//! dead function later hides in plain sight.

/// The version of *what is collected and why*. Bumping it re-asks.

/// writes the rule down. **The rule is the PURPOSE, not the field count** (owner decision,
/// 2026-09-10 — scope, not policy version), and it has exactly two outcomes, which is why the
/// gradient argument below is not the whole story:
///
///  * A new field that **widens what is collected beyond the described purpose of the category it
///    rides in** bumps that category's SCOPE ([`ERRORS_SCOPE`]/[`USAGE_SCOPE`], with a
///    [`SCOPE_CHANGES`] row), and the people who have that category on are asked about that
///    category alone. A whole new report, or a new event, is always this.
///  * A new field **inside a purpose the notice already describes** bumps [`NOTICE_REVISION`]
///    instead: the words change so the notice stays true, and nobody is re-asked. `registered_with_name`
///    and `sealed_identity` (2026-09-10) are the worked example — both answer "how is your sign-in
///    stored", which is the whole of what the version-6 question put, so re-asking for them would
///    have charged a person consent for a more precise answer to the question they already
///    answered. Derivability from a declared field is a SUFFICIENT reason to be in this bucket,
///    not the boundary of it.
///
/// The incentive gradient runs towards never bumping the first kind — every bump costs consent —
/// which is why "does this stay inside the purpose the notice describes" is a written rule with a
/// test behind it (`telemetry::storage`'s `the_storage_report_fields_are_a_documented_list`)
/// rather than a judgement made in review and forgotten.
// Version 4 combines the compatibility/network dimensions introduced by version 3 with handled
// playback-error events and their bounded typed breadcrumb sequence. Existing version-3 answers
// covered the former but not the latter, so they must be asked again rather than silently expanded.
//
// The crash-report identifier (`errors_id`, 2026-09-04) is a new collected field and did NOT bump
// this, by decision: no shipped build has ever carried telemetry (v0.5.0 predates the module), so
// there is no version-4 answer in the world to expand — only the maintainer's own debug installs,
// which are re-answered by hand. The first release that ships the question ships it with the
// identifier already in it. The rule above stands for every bump after that one.
//
// Version 5 (issue #75) adds the handled sign-in error event — a new report a version-4 answer
// never covered, since sign-in was previously invisible to this channel by construction (a failed
// sign-in never reaches an authorized account, and `maybe_ask_consent` only asks once one
// exists). Every existing version-4 answer must be asked again.
//
// Version 6 (issue #76) adds three new facts: a `session_storage` class riding every usage event
// (how this install's saved sign-in is protected — never key material, ciphertext or plaintext,
// the same closed vocabulary as `rtkmem`/`install`), a handled `StorageError` report on the
// Crashes/Errors channel when a seal/open attempt fails, and the same `session_storage` class
// added to the handled sign-in error report (`signin.storage`/`contexts.signin.storage`). None of
// the three was covered by a version-5 answer.

// ---- Model stage M1: per-category consent SCOPE (owner decision, 2026-09-10) -------------------
//
// The rule above this line — one `POLICY_VERSION` shared by both channels, and a bump re-asks
// EVERYONE, about EVERYTHING — is too coarse: "updated the privacy notice → ask everyone again."
// [`POLICY_VERSION`]/[`REASK_CHANGES`]/[`apply`]/[`reask_note`]/[`should_ask`] above stay exactly
// as they were for the one caller that still asks the monolithic question this way — `ui::consent`'s
// first-run screen and its Settings toggle, not yet rebuilt for this model (that is its own,
// later change). Everything below is the model those call sites will move onto: **a notice
// revision (text edits) never re-asks; a consent SCOPE expansion re-asks only the people who have
// that category ON, only for that category; a stored No stays No; an event belonging to a scope a
// person has not yet accepted is held back, never the whole category.**

/// The version of *the words on the consent screen*, with no bearing on who gets asked again.
/// Bumping this changes what the notice SAYS without re-opening the question for anybody — the
/// counterpart to [`ERRORS_SCOPE`]/[`USAGE_SCOPE`], which are what actually gates a re-ask. Not
/// stored on [`Consent`]: nothing here depends on which revision a person last read, because a
/// pure text edit never needs to be told apart from the current one.
///
/// **Not yet read anywhere.** It belongs to the redesigned consent SCREEN this model change is
/// preparing (`ui::consent` still asks the old monolithic question, per-category and all — see
/// [`should_ask`]'s doc), so it has no caller yet; kept and named now so a future text-only notice
/// edit has an obvious place to record "this changed the words, not what is collected".
// Revision 2 (issue #76 review): the notice gained the cross-launch storage-probe paragraph and
// the `write_failed` stage — words changed, not what is collected, so this bumps alone with no
// re-ask. This is the exact edit the doc above asks a text-only notice change to record here.
// Revision 3 (2026-09-10): the storage report gained two facts about the SAME thing scope 6
// already covers — "how your sign-in is stored" — so the notice describes them and nothing is
// re-asked. `registered_with_name` (the app registered under a fixed bus NAME rather than as an
// application service) and `sealed_identity` (which of those identities protects the saved
// sign-in this particular report is about, or `none`). Both fit the data and the purpose the
// version-6 question already put; neither widens either, so `ERRORS_SCOPE` stays at 6 — the exact
// case the notice's own "a new field that still fits the data and purpose you already read about"
// sentence describes.
// Revision 4 (2026-09-11, issue #76's report lane): the storage error report gains a new
// `sign_in_not_persisted` stage plus `persist_outcome`/`preserve_reason`/`candidate_reads`, and the
// one-off sign-in report gains the matching `storage_persist_outcome`/`storage_preserve_reason`/
// `storage_candidate_reads` fields — every one of them still answers "how your sign-in is stored
// and why it could not be", the exact purpose Errors scope 6 already put to whoever has it on, so
// this bumps alone with no re-ask; `ERRORS_SCOPE` stays at 6.
#[allow(dead_code)]

/// * **a channel that was ALREADY on and stays on keeps its OLD accepted scope**, rather than
