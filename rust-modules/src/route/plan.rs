/// Unlike the audio rung this carries no "is it a real pick?" gate, because subtitles do have a
/// "nothing selected" state and use it: probed against the live server, parts carrying a
/// `default`-flagged subtitle come back with no selection at all, so a selection is a choice even
/// when it lands on the container default. The case that would blur it is an ACCOUNT-level

/// picked on this part — subtitles would then come up on every direct play of a foreign-audio
/// item. That is self-correcting (turning them off PUTs `subtitleStreamID=0`, which is a real
/// per-part override) and it is arguably the account setting working, but if it ever needs
/// suppressing, the gate belongs here — not on the flag itself.

///   - an EXTERNAL (sidecar) selection returns None because it has no container ordinal.
///     Renderable text sidecars are restored separately by `apply_plan`; image sidecars
///     still require a server burn.
///   - this is the direct-play path only. The transcode path keeps PUTting `subtitleStreamID=0`
///     (subs off) as before: honouring a selection there means a server-side BURN, i.e. a
///     re-encode carrying a picture-quality cost, which is a trade to put behind the settings
///     surface explicitly rather than to make silently at every play. Once a
///     direct-played item DOES go to the transcoder mid-session (an unsupported DTS/TrueHD audio pick), the
///     seeded `cur_sub_sid` rides along, so the subtitle already on screen keeps burning. Note the
///     read-back is therefore ONE-WAY on that path: an item that starts as a transcode still PUTs
