/// before it is a parameter.
///
/// # Why this is not a bitrate field on [`crate::plex::TranscodeSpec`]
///
/// That is the shape this began as, and it does nothing for the one file it exists for.
/// [`build_stream`] picks direct play → remux → re-encode BEFORE any spec is built, and only the
/// re-encode branch's query has ever carried `maxVideoBitrate`: direct play streams the file's own
/// bytes with no encoder anywhere to read a cap, and a remux copies the codecs and deliberately
/// sends no cap at all (a cap is exactly what would force the re-encode it exists to avoid). So a
/// 30 Mbit/s source on a 4 Mbit/s link — the case the whole feature is about — direct-plays
/// straight past a number set on the spec, and the user who picked "4 Mbps" sees no change
/// whatsoever. `plex::params`' own doc argued this out for a LINK ceiling long before there was a
/// user-chosen one, and the argument transfers unchanged.
///
/// So a rung is spent the way [`crate::plex::link_policy`] spends the relay tier: **deny the two
/// flavors that ship the file at its own rate, leaving the one flavor whose whole point is that
/// the server picks the rate** ([`quality_policy`]). Only then does the rung's number reach the
/// wire, as [`crate::plex::Ceiling`] on the re-encode query.
///
/// # The ladder, and why these rungs
///
/// A standard descending ladder, each rung pairing a rate with the frame that rate can actually
/// carry — a rung that halves the rate and keeps 4K asks the server for something it cannot make
/// look like anything.
///
/// **A rung is a CONTENT rate; the checklist's legs are LINK rates, and the two are not the same
/// number.** LG's #43 CASE1 exercises 512 Kbps / 1 Mbps / 7 Mbps / 17.5 Mbps, and the useful
/// question is which rung a user on each leg would pick — the one comfortably *below* it, since
/// the leg has to carry the stream plus everything else on the line:
///
/// | link leg | the rung that fits |
/// |---|---|
/// | 17.5 Mbit/s | `1080p · 8 Mbps` (`P1080High`'s 20 does NOT fit — it is the rung for an uncapped LAN) |
/// | 7 Mbit/s | `720p · 4 Mbps` |
/// | 1 Mbit/s | `480p · 720 kbps` |
/// | 512 Kbit/s | **nothing** — it is below this ladder's floor, and no rung here pretends otherwise |
///
/// That last row is the honest one and it is why this table exists: three of these rungs carried a
/// comment claiming to sit "under" a leg they are numerically above, which would have sent the
/// next person tuning them to trust a false justification.
///
/// **Original is the migration-safe default and must stay a pure no-op**, which is what the
/// regression test at the foot of this file pins: with `Original` selected, every routing
/// decision and every query byte is what it was before this type existed. Auto is a distinct
/// persisted mode, offered and restored only behind [`auto_quality_ready`]; its top state is an
/// unmodified Original on Local or a measured direct Remote, with fixed-session HLS as the
