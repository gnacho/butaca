//! The `/tmp` developer-trigger surface, behind one door.
//!
//! This app is driven headlessly by ~44 files under `/tmp/plxnative-*`: which screen to boot to,
//! which item to play, which URL to stream, whether to auto-press OK, which PMS token to use.
//! That is how `tests/run.py` and every capture scene work, and it is not going away.
//!
//! It must not exist in a public build. `/tmp` is the SHARED system `/tmp` in the production jail
//! too (mode 1777, both jail profiles), so on an ordinary user's TV every one of those files is a
//! behaviour switch any co-resident process can throw. Three are outright takeovers:
//! `plxnative-token` beats the signed-in session (`app.rs`'s boot gate), `plxnative-servers` hands
//! the app a whole additional server — an address AND the token to trust it with (see [`servers`])
//! — and `plxnative-url` replaces the stream the player feeds.
//!
//! So every read goes through here, and here is `#[cfg]`-gated on the `devtriggers` feature. In a
//! `--no-default-features` build [`flag`] is `false` and [`read`] is `None` at COMPILE time, the
//! branches behind them fold away, and the binary opens nothing under `/tmp` but its own logs.
//!
//! Two rules for anything added later:
//!
//! 1. **Never open a `/tmp` path directly.** The grep that audits this (`/tmp/plxnative-` outside
//!    this module and the four unconditional log sinks) is the only thing keeping the property
//!    true. The two profiler logs are dev-only and listed in [`DIAG`] below.
//! 2. **A gate is not always a path.** `any_trigger_present` scans the whole directory and names
//!    no file at all — it was the one surface a literal-replacement sweep would have missed, and
//!    it silently changes which screen the app boots to. Structural surfaces that take no name
//!    (the capture listener's `INADDR_ANY` socket, the remote FIFO's `mkfifo`) are gated at their
//!    call sites in `app.rs` for the same reason.
//!
//! The four unconditional LOG sinks are deliberately NOT here and stay in every build: they are creates, not
//! reads, they are how on-device crash triage works at all, and writing them is not a way for
//! another process to steer this one.

/// Files that are pure diagnostics rather than automation — see [`any_trigger_present`].
///
/// Every log this app writes belongs here, not just its trigger. `plxnative-anim` was listed and
/// `plxnative-anim.log` was not, while arming the overlay creates exactly that file and nothing
