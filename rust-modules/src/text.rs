//! SDL2_ttf text rendering (was src/text.c): font cache + glyph-texture LRU +
//! draw_text. Main-thread only (all GL), so the caches are plain statics (no
//! locking). Uses gfx's link_program/use_prog (crate path). Mostly GL/TTF FFI —
//! the retui text backend.
//!
//! The glyph cache is an LRU **with a hot window** since phase 11 (spec §8.1): an entry drawn
//! within the last eight frames is not evicted while any colder slot exists, and the case where
//! every slot is hot gives way rather than refusing — counted, not silent. See [`evict_slot`],
//! [`begin_frame`] and [`take_evicted_hot`].
//!
//! # The fallback chain, and why the unit of work is a RUN
//!
//! Inter carries 2853 codepoints — Latin, Cyrillic, Greek — and no Hangul, Kana or Han at all, so
//! a Korean, Japanese or Chinese Plex library used to render as tofu end to end. SDL2_ttf 2.0.x
//! has **no fallback-font API**: one `TTF_Font` is one face, and `TTF_RenderUTF8_Blended` draws
//! whatever that one face has, box glyphs included. So the chain has to be built here, and
//! building it means changing the unit of work from a *string* to a **run**:
//!
//!   1. split the string into maximal runs, each entirely drawable by ONE face
//!      ([`split_runs`], deciding per character through [`crate::fontcov`]),
//!   2. render each run with its own face,
//!   3. composite the run surfaces side by side, **aligned on the baseline**, into one buffer,
//!   4. upload that buffer exactly as a single-run string was uploaded before.
//!
//! Step 4 is what keeps everything downstream unchanged: the 160-slot LRU still keys on
//! `(string bytes, size, bold)` — run splitting is a pure function of the string, so the key still
//! determines the texture — and the `ink_t`/`ink_b` cap-band machinery still measures one texture.
//!
//! **The chain, in order:** Inter (`appfont.ttf`) → the **bundled** `appfont-cjk.ttf` → the
//! television's own `/usr/share/fonts/DroidSansFallback.ttf`. The bundled face is the guarantee,
//! because a submission is graded on whatever firmware the reviewer happens to have; the system
//! face behind it is free insurance, measured present on webOS 4.10.0 (2026-08-23: 11172/11172
//! Hangul, 20902 Han, Kana, and — see below — no Hebrew and no Arabic).
//!
//! **Baseline, not top.** Two faces have two line boxes, so compositing by the surface top would
//! shift Latin down whenever a CJK glyph shared the line. Every run is placed so its baseline
//! lands on the BASE face's baseline (`TTF_RenderUTF8_Blended` puts the baseline `TTF_FontAscent`
//! rows from the top), and the composite keeps the base face's box. That box provably contains the
//! fallback's ink at every rung of `theme::size`: measured host-side through FreeType with
//! SDL_ttf's own metric arithmetic, Noto Sans CJK's ink top is 16..53 px against Inter's 22..70 px
//! ascent for 22..72 px sizes, and its descent is shallower at every rung. Swept across the whole
//! Hangul / Han / Kana / fullwidth repertoire the fallback's ink reaches 0.842–0.939 em above the
//! baseline against Inter's 0.9688 em ascent, so the `y < 0` guard in [`render_runs`] discards only
//! blank rows. The single exception in the font is **U+3031** (a vertical-writing kana repeat mark,
//! 1.323 em), which SDL_ttf already clips inside its own run surface before the compositor sees it.
//!
//! One consequence of anchoring on the base face, worth knowing before anyone reports it as a bug:
//! `text_cap_band` still measures Inter's "H", so a CJK label vertically centred through
//! [`text_vcenter_y`] is centred on INTER's cap band, not on its own ink. CJK glyphs fill more of
//! the em than Latin caps do (at 28 px: ink 21 px above the baseline against Inter's 15), so such a
//! label sits ~1–2 px lower than optically centred. That is deliberate, not an oversight — the cap
//! band is string-INDEPENDENT by design (see [`text_cap_band`]), which is what makes every label of
//! a size align with every other, and making it depend on the script would break that for the mixed
//! lines this feature exists to draw.
//!
//! **The fallback face is NOT emboldened for bold runs.** It ships at one weight (a second is
//! ~21 MB), and SDL_ttf's synthetic bold is `FT_Outline_Embolden` at ppem/10 — 2.2 px at
//! `size::MICRO`. Rendered against this face that fills 電視劇, 曇天 and 鬱 into solid blocks at
//! **every** size in the ladder, 22 through 40. A weight mismatch beside bold Latin is a
//! typographic compromise; an illegible ideograph is a defect, so bold runs use the regular
//! fallback face.
//!
//! **RTL is out of scope.** No link of the chain has Hebrew or Arabic, and that is deliberate
//! twice over: coverage is not support. Arabic needs joining and contextual shaping, Hebrew needs
//! bidi reordering, and neither exists anywhere in this module — `TTF_RenderUTF8_Blended` in
//! SDL2_ttf 2.0.x is a left-to-right advance loop with no shaper behind it. Adding a face without
//! a shaper would turn tofu into fluent-looking WRONG text, which is harder to notice and worse to
//! ship. `fontcov`'s `rtl_is_out_of_scope_and_stays_that_way` asserts the absence so this stays a
//! decision rather than an oversight.
