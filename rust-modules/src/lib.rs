//! plxnative-modules — the Rust app core, built as a staticlib and linked into the C
//! boot shim. The crate's C surface is tiny: C calls `plex_run` (app.rs), writes the fallback
//! image marker through `plx_crash_write_image_marker`, re-enters the native-crash spool through
//! `plx_sentry_spool_external`, and forwards the two Starfish callbacks (`sf_on_event`/
//! `acb_on_event`, player/mod.rs). Everything else is Rust-internal (the per-module `repr(C)`
//! shapes are migration legacy, not ABI).
