//! plxnative-modules — the Rust app core, built as a staticlib and linked into the C
//! boot shim. The crate's C surface is tiny: C calls `plex_run` (app.rs), writes the fallback
//! image marker through `plx_crash_write_image_marker`, re-enters the native-crash spool through
//! `plx_sentry_spool_external`, and forwards the two Starfish callbacks (`sf_on_event`/
//! `acb_on_event`, player/mod.rs). Everything else is Rust-internal (the per-module `repr(C)`
//! shapes are migration legacy, not ABI).

pub(crate) mod testlock {
    //! One lock for every test that touches a process-global.
    //!
    //! Some remaining async seams are process-wide by construction — metadata's `static mut CURRENT`, route's play
    //! mailbox, the player's SHARED block — so tests in DIFFERENT modules contend on the same
    //! state and `cargo test` threads them. A per-module mutex cannot see that: the season and
    //! detail mailboxes are two test functions in one file, but the season generation also moves
    //! under `pump_detail` (which calls `supersede_season`).
    //!
    //! Hold the guard for the whole test. Poison is stepped over so a failing test reports ITS
    //! assertion instead of dragging every later one down with a poison panic.
    //!
    //! **The lock also RECORDS who holds it, and that half is what makes the rule enforceable.**
    //! A mutex nobody is obliged to take is a convention, and a convention that is broken in one
    //! test out of two thousand does not fail — it hands some *other* module's test a wiped store
    //! at a rate low enough to read as flakiness. That is exactly how
    //! `app::chrome`'s `four_libraries_on_two_servers_publish_two_type_destinations` failed: its
    //! own `browse::reset()` + `seed_two_source_table_for_test()` are adjacent statements, so the
    //! table could only have been emptied by another thread, and the only thread that can run
    //! beside a lock holder is one that never took the lock.
    //!
    //! So [`serial`] publishes the holding thread in [`OWNER`], and [`assert_held`] — called from
    //! every crate-global mutator a test can reach — turns "somebody wrote this without the lock"
    //! from an intermittent failure in a bystander into a deterministic panic in the culprit,
    //! naming the culprit. Add the call to any new global store; do not add a retry anywhere.
    //!
    //! **This SUPERSEDES the static allowlist approach spec §14/§15.2 used earlier in the
    //! restructure (`ci/allow/statics-migration.txt` and friends) for the stores specifically.**
    //! That DoD criterion scopes a bare `static mut` OUT of `screens`/`ui` engine code — it asks
    //! "does a SCREEN still own process-wide state a second instance would corrupt", and an
    //! allowlisted exception there is a debt with a name and a phase number. A store's data module
    //! (`pms`, `metadata`, `search`) is a different question entirely: those remaining
    //! compatibility stores keep process-wide statics **by design** — `docs/stores-as-machines.md`
    //! §1 is explicit about that temporary shape. Browse, Person and ViewState have since moved to
    //! per-`Bridge` physical owners, and their owner gates reject a restored process global. For
    //! each remaining compatibility store, an allowlist entry would therefore be a permanent
    //! fixture wearing a temporary label. What such a store genuinely owes is not "stop being
    //! global" but "a test that mutates you holds the one lock every other
    //! test mutating you also holds", which is exactly what [`assert_held`] enforces at every
    //! mutator a test can reach, rather than at the `static` declaration site. Put differently: the
    //! allowlist answers "is this global allowed to exist", the assertion answers "was this write to
    //! it safe" — a store answers yes to the first question unconditionally, so only the second one
    //! applies to it.
    //!
    //! **Phase 12 / D5 closed the coverage this claim depends on** (2026-09-10): each remaining
    //! process-global store's `apply`/`run` funnel asserts (`stores::hubs::run`,
    //! `stores::metadata::run` and `stores::search::run`), as does every
    //! `_for_test` installer that touches shared state. Browse, Person and ViewState fixtures instead own
    //! explicit stores; Browse's helpers cover source, pin,
    //! table, item, letter and query seeds without selecting process Browse state. Helpers that
    //! also touch the shared session or server registry assert the same lock. The remaining global
    //! installers include `metadata.rs`
    //! (`install_for_test`, `set_current_for_test`, `begin_detail_for_test`,
    //! `land_detail_for_test`), `search.rs` (`publish_shelves_for_test`,
    //! `debounce_elapsed_for_test`) and `pms.rs`'s own eleven sites — and so does every entry point of
    //! the server registry a test can reach: `plex::servers::register_with_client_id` (and the
    //! `register_lazy` seam it and its sibling test constructors share), `revoke_all`,
    //! `set_current` and `reset_for_test`. A three-run `make check` plus a ten-run
    //! `--test-threads 16` stress at this coverage level turned up no test that had been writing a
    //! store without the lock — which says the existing call sites were already disciplined, not
    //! that the assertion was unnecessary: it is what keeps that true as the suite grows, instead of
    //! relying on every future PR remembering the convention on its own.
