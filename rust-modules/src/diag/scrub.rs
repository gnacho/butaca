//! **The redaction pass** — the one place a diagnostic line is made safe to leave the device.
//!
//! Lifted out of `lab/snapshot.rs` unchanged on 2026-08-29, for two reasons that are worth keeping
//! written down.
//!
//! **It is no longer lab-only.** `crate::log` applies [`scrub_local`] to every line before the file
//! write, and the telemetry client applies the full [`scrub`] to everything that leaves. Both live
//! in a build that has no `lab-diagnostics` feature, so this module is UNGATED — which also means
//! its tests finally run in `make check`. They did not before: everything under `lab/` is
//! `#[cfg(feature = "lab-diagnostics")]`, so the 31 assertions guarding the one function the whole
//! privacy argument rests on were skipped by the default gate entirely.
//!
//! **There are two exits, and the difference is the whole design.**
//!
//! * [`scrub`] may return [`Scrubbed::Refuse`] — drop the line and count it. Correct for anything
//!   crossing the network, where a line that cannot be made safe must not be sent.
//! * [`scrub_local`] **rewrites only and never drops.** It is what the on-disk event log gets. A
//!   line silently vanishing from `plxnative-events.log` is strictly worse for debugging than a
//!   leaky one — that file is what `make run`, `tests/run.py`'s assertions and `crash-triage` all
//!   read, and `docs/agent-reference.md` calls it "the primary debugging surface".
//!
//! So: rewrite locally, rewrite-or-refuse remotely, and never a second scrubber anywhere.
