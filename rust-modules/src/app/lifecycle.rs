// D8 (UI restructure phase 12): relocated verbatim from `app/mod.rs`'s `root_back_tests`. The

// `app/input.rs` — only the TEST is moved, which D8 asks for by name; grouping it beside the
// foreground/background lifecycle tests above is the judgment call `app::App` reaching "the
// television took the screen back" (`back_at_root`) and "the app keeps running through this" are
// both properties of the app's OWN outer lifecycle, in the sense this module's other half already
// tests, even though today's `ForegroundLifecycle` type itself does not cover them.
#[cfg(test)]
mod root_back_tests {
    //! **BACK at a ROOT hands the screen back to the television, and the app keeps running.**
    //!
    //! [`back_at_root`] is driven for real — it is the app's whole answer to "there is nowhere
    //! further back to go", and the regression to catch is a future edit putting `running = false`,
    //! or a modal question, back where the platform call now goes. [`after_cancel`] is pure,
    //! because its callers reach `auth`/`webos`, neither of which a unit test wants to drive.
    //!
    //! **Phase 6 retired the other half this module doc used to describe** — `onboarding_back`,
    //! `OnboardBack` and their five tests, which pinned issues #16-#18's rule as it was reached from
    //! the legacy `key_onboarding` key ladder. The RULE did not change (the Session adapter
    //! performs the `after_cancel` policy those tests exercised); what moved is WHO decides "is this press the screen's own
    //! modal or the app's root" — since phase 6 that is `screens::login`/`screens::profiles`'s own
    //! job, reading their own focus-engine state (a PIN pad's open flag, on the owned
    //! `ProfilesScreen`) that this module cannot see and must not reach into (`app/` never names a
    //! sibling `screens/` module's internals). A host test of that half now belongs beside the
    //! screens that make the decision, not here.
    //!
    //! What NO host test can say is that the television actually shows its launcher and that the
    //! process survives it. That is `webos::go_home`'s device half — `gohome: SAM accepted`, a
    //! capture of the launcher (on webOS 4 a RIBBON over the still-running app, so no lifecycle
    //! event at all) and `fuser` reporting one pid throughout — and it is why this file's
    //! `home_requests` counter grades the DECISION and never the outcome.
