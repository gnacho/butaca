//! Section identity versus visual order.
//!
//! Lookups and saved-column memory index by [`SectionId`]. Visual order is a separate list.
//! The compact title no longer has named hide ANCHORS — it fades out as whatever section is first
//! in visual order begins to travel (`super::compact_title_alpha`), so adding a section cannot
//! leave a 72px wordmark drawn over it. A section without a
//! slot cannot be stored by accident: the slot index is this enum's discriminant, and
//! [`crate::metadata::SPOT_SECTION_SLOTS`] is that count.
