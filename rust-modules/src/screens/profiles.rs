//! **The who's-watching picker, as an owned `Screen`** (restructure spec §13, phase 6 —
//! `ui/profiles.rs` moved). The avatar row (`crate::ui::card_row`, a circular `RowStyle::PROFILES`
//! shelf — the same shelf motion the poster rows use) plus the "Sign out" footer, and the PIN
//! keypad for a protected profile. With nobody to offer (#132's read-out) the footer gives way to
//! the read-out's own control row: a focused *Back* whose OK is the BACK key, then *Sign out*.
//!
//! **One struct, no globals.** The legacy screen kept its whole scene in two `static mut`s
//! (`SCENE`, `FOOTER_POP`) and its own hand-rolled focus ladder (`Act`, `act`, `step_fc`,
//! `step_focus`, `nearest_col`); this file has neither. Focus is the ENGINE's — this screen
//! answers the §7.1 query protocol and reacts to `ScreenEvent::FocusMoved`, it never stores
//! "which avatar is selected" as its own truth. What it DOES keep as ordinary fields is: the
//! `CardRow` animation cache the avatar row's springs live in (a render cache, not logical state,
//! exactly like `RootPage::table`), the footer's `CtlPop` dip, and the PIN pad's own small state
//! machine (open/target/entry/submitting/error), which is genuinely this screen's own — nothing
//! else on the tree knows a PIN pad exists.
//!
//! **The PIN keypad is a `Grid` with a HOLE**, spec §7.1 and open question 2: 4 rows × 3 columns,
//! bottom-left empty (a phone dial pad's own layout, delete in the bottom-right where every phone
//! puts it). `ui/geom.rs`'s reusable `Grid` view is built for a DIFFERENT shape — a column of
//! shelves, one `Row` group per shelf — so it does not fit a single grid-with-a-hole group; the
//! walk below (`pad_neighbour`) is written by hand instead.
//!
//! **`GroupKind::Grid { holes, .. }` is metadata ONLY here — the production engine never reads
//! it.** The one place `GroupKind` is matched at all is `ui/focus.rs`'s `#[cfg(test)] mod tree`,
//! a fixture adapter for that module's own golden tables (pinned there by
//! `a_grid_hole_is_skipped_along_the_direction_of_travel`, which grades the FIXTURE tree, not
//! this screen); a real group's traversal always comes from its own `Focusable::neighbour`, which
//! is `pad_neighbour` for this one. An earlier version of this comment claimed `pad_neighbour`
//! deliberately reproduced that fixture's "skip along the direction of travel" rule as a
//! considered improvement over the legacy screen's sideways deflection — that claim was never
//! exercised by anything a user could reach, and for THIS grid's shape (the hole sits in the
//! grid's own LAST row) it is actively wrong: skipping straight down from '7' runs off the bottom
//! edge with nothing to land on, so the key press does nothing at all. `pad_neighbour` deflects
//! sideways instead, exactly as the legacy `nearest_col` did — see its own doc for the exact rule.
//! **The `holes` field is left in `pad_group_spec` as descriptive metadata, but it is a SECOND
//! source of truth for the same fact `KEYS` already carries** (`draw_pad`/`pad_place`/
//! `pad_group_of` all derive "is this cell a hole" from `KEYS[r][c].is_none()` directly, never
//! from `PAD_HOLES`). `declared_pad_holes_match_the_keys_and_edges` now checks that the declaration
//! and rendered cells agree, so a shape change cannot silently leave stale metadata behind.
//! A shared grid-with-a-hole helper in `ui/focus.rs`, built to WALK from the same
//! `holes` list a `GroupSpec` declares (rather than reading `KEYS` by hand here), would close that
//! gap for this screen and for the next grid-with-a-hole the app builds; none exists today.
//!
//! **The digits are handled in `step`; no raw `key(sym)` function survives** (spec open question
//! 2). A number key types straight into the PIN without moving the visual cursor (the remote's
//! digit buttons carry the same 48-57 ASCII range in `sym`/`wcode` the legacy `digit_of` read, and
//! that pure function is unchanged); OK on a keypad cell presses whatever cell the cursor is on,
//! delivered as an ordinary `ScreenEvent::Activate` — the keys are `ElemKind::Bare`, so the engine
//! fires that on the key-DOWN edge with no press arm at all, exactly as a `Card`/`Control` MUST
//! NOT (see the next paragraph).
//!
//! **The avatar row and the footer arm presses through DIFFERENT doors and commit through one.**
//! An avatar is `ElemKind::Card` (`ui/geom.rs`'s `Shelf`, unmodified — this is the first owned
//! screen to use it for a real `Card` group), the "Sign out" footer is `ElemKind::Control`, and
//! the PIN keys are `ElemKind::Bare`. Card and Control both arm a press through `Fx::Press` (a
//! holdable one for the avatar, a non-holdable one for the footer — `ui/screen.rs`'s doc on
//! `ElemKind`) and both commit through the SAME `ScreenEvent::PressCommit`, which is where this
//! screen reads `cx.focus.current` to learn which of the two just committed (the press machine
//! never says WHAT it pressed, only that a press attached to the current owner completed — the
//! same reason `screens::consent`'s own `PressCommit` arm reads `cx.focus.current`). Getting Bare
//! vs Card/Control right is the difference between a tile that dips on OK and one that does not:
//! a Bare element skips the whole press machine, so a keypad key drawn with a spring dip would be
//! animating a state the engine never actually enters.
//!
//! **The pad is modal over the picker.** While it is open, `groups()` answers with the pad's ONE
//! group and nothing else — no avatar row, no footer — which is what traps focus inside it: the
//! engine's geometric search has no other group to find, in any direction, so every key the pad
//! itself declines (an edge run into a wall) resolves to `Outcome::Nothing` rather than escaping
//! onto the roster underneath. **Closing it must not leave a verdict from the last attempt
//! following a fresh picker onto the screen.** Every door out of the pad emits typed
//! [`auth::SessionCmd::DismissPinError`] through [`ProfilesScreen::close_pad`]; the mounter emits
//! the same command beside a fresh constructor. A rejected PIN is the one exception that keeps the
//! pad up (the dot row flashes red and the entry restarts) rather than closing it.
//!
//! **A pointer click "outside the pad" has no generic answer here and has to be built by hand.**
//! Unlike a `Popover` on the `ModalStack` (whose `on_miss(style)` policy the container itself
//! consults), the PIN pad is not a container surface — it is a screen's own internal state — so
//! there is no `OnMiss::Dismiss` for it to opt into. `dispatch.rs` does deliver the raw
//! `ScreenEvent::Input(InputEvent{kind: InputKind::Click{hit,..},..})` to every owning screen
//! REGARDLESS of whether the click resolved onto a stop (confirmed by reading `frame_with`'s
//! ingest loop: the `Delivery::Screen(ScreenEvent::Input(ev))` push is unconditional on `ev.kind`,
//! after the pointer-specific hit resolution has already written `hit`), so `hit.is_none()` while
//! the pad is open is exactly "the click landed on none of the twelve cells" — the legacy
//! `pad_click`'s `PadClick::Dismiss` arm, reproduced from the frozen primitives rather than a
//! library addition.
