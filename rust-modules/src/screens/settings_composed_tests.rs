//! **THE LEFT ROAD, EXECUTED** (§7.3 step 2 + rule 9) — the one road into this surface that
//! no test ran end to end.
//!
//! The BACK road is executed: `app/bridge.rs`'s
//! `the_settings_surface_owns_input_and_walks_its_own_stack` drives a real `Dispatcher`, the
//! real surface and real `Key::Back` presses, root → Legal → back → root → dismissed. LEFT is
//! supposed to mean the same thing — "LEFT returns to the index, and only a second LEFT
//! leaves the family", which `ui/legal.rs`'s
//! `right_enters_a_document_and_left_walks_all_the_way_back_out` pinned for the legacy screens
//! and which went out of the tree WITH that module in phase 5b — and after the port it was
//! true only as the COMPOSITION of three links, each tested somewhere else and never together:
//!
//!  1. the table/document groups declare `EdgeRule::Nav(NavOpKind::Back)` on their LEFT edge
//!     (`ui::table_screen`'s own tests, and `screens::legal`'s, assert the edge array),
//!  2. `dispatch::after_step` turns that outcome into a synthetic `Key::Back` down with
//!     `at_edge: true` delivered to the input OWNER (`dispatch::edge_back_tests`, against a
//!     hand-built screen that counts BACKs and decrements an integer "depth"),
//!  3. `RouteSurface` walks its own `NavStack` on a BACK and declines one at its root (the
//!     tests in `settings_root_navigation_tests.rs`, which hand-feed `Key::Back` with
//!     `at_edge: false` and have no engine at all).
//!
//! Every link can stay green while the chain is broken, because no link's test contains the
//! next one's subject: link 2's owner is not this surface, and link 3's harness cannot
//! produce an edge. That is not hypothetical — link 2 IS a repair, of an engine shortcut that
//! sent the edge straight to `Navigation::back` and so dismissed the whole surface where a
//! BACK press had walked its stack (`after_step`'s own comment). This module runs the chain:
//! a real `Dispatcher`, a real `RouteSurface` presented into it as an `Opaque` modal, a real
//! LEFT through the real engine, and the two ends of the rule asserted — at depth the inner
//! stack pops and the surface stays up, at the root the surface is dismissed.
//!
//! **The link still not executed here is the DOCUMENT's own LEFT.** Reaching a Legal document
//! takes a second press, and at that depth the edge rule is `DocumentFocus`'s rather than the
//! table's — a different link 1, with links 2 and 3 identical (the surface sees a BACK and
//! pops, whatever declared the edge). `screens::legal`'s `a_document_s_left_edge_is_back_to_
//! the_index` grades that declaration on its own. What is proven below is the index level:
//! one LEFT back to the Settings root, a second one out of the family.
//!
//! The bundle is the family's own inner host, which is what makes this possible from this
//! file at all: `InnerHost` is a complete `Host` (`screens::family`) AND satisfies `AppLike`,
//! so `Dispatcher<InnerHost>` mounts the same `RouteSurface` the bridge does. The app's real
//! bundle (`app/bridge.rs`'s `AppHost`) cannot be named here — its `Arg` carries the legacy
//! `Route`, which is `app`-private — so what this cannot see is the app's own mounter and
//! nothing else; the dispatcher, the engine, the containers and the surface are the shipping
//! ones.
