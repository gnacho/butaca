//! Rust port of src/posters.c — async poster/artwork texture store (posters.h).
//! Same C ABI. Rewritten on std::sync instead of the C's pthread globals: a
//! Mutex<Store> + Condvar + std::thread workers. The decoded-pixel pointer is
//! stored as an address (usize) so the shared Store stays Send. GL calls
//! (upload/delete) run only on the main thread (poster_pump / poster_get);
//! workers only fetch (via the typed client) + decode (Rust img) off the lock.
//!
//! ## Every entry point names a SERVER, and none of them assumes one
//!
//! Artwork is per-server in the strongest sense: `/photo/:/transcode?url=…` is a path on ONE
//! PMS, its `url=` is that server's own thumb key, and the token baked into it is that server's
//! grant. With a friend's shared server merged into one Home, "the current server" is the wrong
//! host for half the tiles on screen — so a [`ServerId`] rides every call, sits in the slot as
//! the other half of its identity, and is what the worker dials. Nothing in this file reads
//! `plex::client()`; a caller that genuinely means "the server I am browsing" says so by passing
//! `plex::current_server()`, at the call site, where it is visible.
//!
//! The server is a FIELD on the slot, not a prefix on the key, deliberately: keys already run
//! ~140 bytes (an ordinary relative thumb) to ~177 (an absolute headshot — see [`poster_key`])
//! into a fixed [`PT_KEYLEN`]-byte array (see [`Pslot::key`]), and a `u16` compare is also the
//! cheaper half of the per-frame identity scan, so it goes first.
