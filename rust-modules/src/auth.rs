/// (`webos::go_home`) and this flow keeps running behind it. Until 2026-09-03 the callers swallowed
/// the key instead.
///
/// **…and false at the BOOT picker when the stored profile is PIN-protected, which is a privilege
/// gate and not an ergonomic one.** The paragraph above reasons only about "carry on as the profile
/// I'm already signed in as", which is true from Home and false at boot: in the ordinary Plex Home
/// arrangement the adult profile is the protected one, so adult uses the app → child boots it →
/// picker → BACK reinstated the adult's per-user token and entered Home as them, with no code
/// entered. (Two presses did it from an open keypad, since BACK there only closes the pad.) The PIN
/// path itself was never wrong — plex.tv validates it and the no-network fast path in
/// [`switch_thread`] already excludes protected tiles — the hole was entirely in this escape hatch.
/// So a boot picker over a protected profile must be left by CHOOSING: pick a tile and enter its
/// PIN, or take the picker's own *Sign out* pill, which is focusable with ▼ whatever the roster
/// holds. The rule is [`may_resume`]; who is asking is [`Picker`].
///
/// **…and the SAME escalation reached the same place by the door that fix left open, which is now
/// shut too.** *Change profile* was permissive on the reasoning in the paragraph above the
/// refusals — Home is behind that picker and its user is already signed in as that profile. But
/// that reasons about the person who PRESSED it, and *Change profile* is the one control in the app
/// somebody presses because they are about to stop being the person holding the remote: enter a
/// protected profile → *Change profile* → the picker appears → BACK → straight back inside the
/// protected profile, no PIN. So that picker DETACHES now ([`detaches_active_profile`]) and is a
/// ROOT: nothing behind it, and BACK restores nothing — deliberately not even an unprotected
/// previous profile, since "BACK works iff the profile you left has no PIN" is a rule whose
/// behaviour announces whether a PIN exists, and one tile press is the entire cost of the
/// consistent version.
///
/// **"Protected" also covers a session that names NO profile**, which is not a corner case but the
/// second half of the same hole: a sign-in abandoned at the who's-watching picker persists the
/// account token, the server and the roster with no profile chosen (deliberately — see
/// `login_thread`), and such a session's [`Session::pms_token`] falls back to the OWNER's server
/// token. The next boot raises a picker over exactly that, so BACK there handed out the owner's
/// credentials by a second road. [`Session::active_profile_is_protected`] is where that is decided.
///
/// The gate is a PICKER's, and `ui::login`'s BACK is left as it was, because in a shipped build it
/// cannot be this escalation: the boot gate only routes to the sign-in screen when `can_go_local()`
/// is false, which is the refusal above, and every other way onto that screen is somebody already
/// at Home. It is also the one screen with no *Sign out* pill to leave by. What it does now get is
/// the strict [`Picker`] default — no picker of its own means no `from` of its own, and the value
/// it inherits should not be the permissive one; the practical effect is confined to the dev-only
/// `/tmp/plxnative-login` boot, which is the one way to reach that screen over a live session.

/// admin and is never replaced by a Plex Home switch — so every `accessToken` in the answer is the
/// ADMIN's per-(user, server) grant. Installing those while a managed profile is watching swaps the
/// wrong identity's token into every registered `Client` in place (that swap is what the ~30 call
/// sites holding a `&'static Client` are built to follow) and then persists it: browsing and
/// scrobbling as the account owner from someone else's profile. For a RESTRICTED profile it is
/// worse than wrong, it is a re-grant — [`retoken`] had already blanked and hidden the servers that
/// profile was not given, and this puts them back.
///
/// Re-keying the answer for the active profile afterwards is not available: the per-user tokens
/// only exist in a `/api/v2/resources` fetched with THAT user's account token, which the switch
/// obtains for one request and does not persist. So the honest answer is to skip, and the cost is
/// named: a share granted while a managed profile is signed in appears when someone next switches
/// profile (the switch re-keys the whole roster from its own response) or signs in again.
