/// **A Dolby Vision record must survive a second video stream that has none.** `fps` and `hdr`
/// take the LAST `streamType: 1` stream in the part and that is harmless for both; the DV
/// record is read by `route::video_direct_plays`, so blanking it back to the all-zero default
/// re-opens the direct-play gate and the file plays in the wrong colours — the exact bug the
/// gate exists for. No part on the dev server carries two video streams today (all 540 leaves
/// swept 2026-08-21), which is precisely why this is a test and not a measurement: embedded
/// cover art is an ordinary thing for a library to contain and nothing else here would notice.
