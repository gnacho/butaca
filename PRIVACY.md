# PlxNative Privacy Policy

Applies to PlxNative 0.6.6. Last updated 12 September 2026.

## Who is responsible for PlxNative data

Gleb Linnik is responsible only for data PlxNative stores locally and for optional reports you
choose to share. Contact: `support@plxnative.com`.

## Plex services

PlxNative is an independent client for Plex. To sign you in, discover servers and provide Plex
account features, the app communicates directly with Plex services. Plex processes information
received by those services under [Plex’s own Privacy
Policy](https://www.plex.tv/about/privacy-legal/). PlxNative’s developer does not receive that
information.

## Plex Media Servers

To browse and play media, update watch progress and use server features, PlxNative communicates
directly with the Plex Media Servers you select. Those requests are handled by the selected server
and its operator. PlxNative’s developer does not receive them.

## Data stored on this television

PlxNative stores your Plex account token and a separate token for each server you use, the
addresses and identifiers of those servers, the profile you selected together with the profile
names and pictures on your account, your Home library choices, your recent searches, your playback
quality preference, and local diagnostic logs. It also stores your answers to the two
optional-reporting questions, the random Crash report ID if you turned crash reports on, the
random Analytics ID if you turned product analytics on, any report waiting to be sent, and a
marker recording how much of the crash log has already been read.
It keeps no bookmark of its own for where you stopped watching: playback position is held by your
Plex Media Server. The Settings screen can sign out and remove PlxNative data from this television.
The canonical session and reporting decision share one versioned record in a private database kind
owned by PlxNative's packaged storage service. The database object contains only its fixed metadata
and an opaque typed JSON document; older external and app-local `auth.json`/telemetry files are
migration candidates only and are removed only after the new record is verified.

On newer and unknown webOS versions, PlxNative first attempts to encrypt your tokens through the
television's authenticated Keymanager3 service. If it cannot do so during a fresh sign-in or
migration, it may keep that newly supplied token bundle in an explicit ACL-only envelope inside
the private database kind so sign-in still survives; the failure is eligible for the storage
diagnostic described below. An ordinary settings change never replaces existing healthy
ciphertext. PlxNative selects the same ACL-only form directly when the television reports webOS
major 1–4; runtime evidence currently covers webOS 4.10.2 only. Private database access is isolation and persistence, not encryption
and not protection from root access.

Those lifetimes differ. Signing out immediately clears the in-memory sign-in and reporting gates,
then queues one non-identifying `ClearTenure` tombstone covering both Session and reporting consent
so the app will not re-import the old account. The app does not permit a new sign-in until that
tombstone is durably confirmed. It
also queues removal of the old sign-in material, servers registered with it and their tokens — and with them your
optional-reporting answers, both identifiers and any queued report,
because those choices were made by the person who signed in and say nothing about whoever signs
in next: the next sign-in is asked afresh. Switching between the profiles of one Plex account is
not a sign-out and keeps them. A queued report is deleted once sent. Switching a category off
immediately closes its gate and deletes its identifier, then queues removal of that category's
reports. Signing out, or Delete all local data, immediately closes every reporting gate and clears
pending in-memory reports, then queues removal of everything on disk, including a one-off report
you already pressed "Send" for — a one-off report belongs to no category, so only those two erase
it. The event and stderr logs start fresh on each launch; the crash log is append-only across
launches until Delete all local data queues its removal. External candidate
files can survive an uninstall because webOS gives an application no way to run code as it is
removed; the packaged app directory is removed with the application, while external migration
sources may remain. Cleanup is separate from the cleared record's durability: the app reports an
incomplete cleanup, and a failure can leave obsolete material behind, but closed reporting gates
do not permit that material to be sent. Delete all local data queues the same non-identifying
cleared record and removal of recoverable session material. Resolve any failure it reports before
uninstalling if you also want external PlxNative data removed.

## Optional crash reports

Crash reporting is off until you choose to share it. If enabled, PlxNative sends technical crash
details to Sentry in Germany. A report may include the signal, code addresses, thread information,
internal component labels, app and webOS versions, television model and hardware compatibility
details needed to reproduce and symbolicate the failure.

A native crash report may also contain the last 16 window diagnostic steps: entering or leaving
background, querying the native window, and beginning or completing the first frame after return.
These steps include technical timestamps, fixed labels, whether playback was active, whether display/surface handles were
available, and SDL's version numbers. They contain no window addresses or viewing content.
They are collected only while crash reporting is enabled and accompany a crash rather than being
sent as usage events. Disabling crash reports removes the local trace.

Every crash report and every automatic error report carries a **Crash report ID**: a random
identifier created on this television when you turn crash reports on, sent as the report's
`user.id`. The one-off sign-in report described below is the one exception and carries no `user`
field at all. It exists so that
repeated crashes under one Crash report ID are counted once rather than once each — Sentry's
"users affected" figure is the number of distinct Crash report IDs an issue has reached — which is
what tells a problem that hit many people apart from one television that hit it many times. It is not derived from your Plex
account, your television or anything about you, and it is never sent with product analytics.
Settings shows it while crash reports are on. Turning crash reports off, or signing out, deletes
the local identifier; enabling them later creates a new one. Reports already sent keep the old
identifier, so copy it down first if you intend to ask for their deletion.

The same independent choice also covers a handled playback-error report when playback reaches its
explicit terminal error screen. That report contains a fixed failure kind, delivery and quality
classes, coarse raster, rate, HTTP and buffer classes, whether a first picture appeared, and at
most 32 typed playback transitions with bucketed elapsed times. It contains no title, ratingKey,
URL, path, playhead, duration, exact bitrate, server identity, address, token, account or profile,
and is not joined to the product analytics identifier or `playback_id`. It carries the same Crash
report ID as a crash report, and the same television model, SoC, hardware revision, webOS release
and the `rtkmem`/`install` sandbox facts a crash report carries. Buffering, seeking, holding
a low quality, or rejecting an adaptive-bitrate candidate does not by itself send a report.
The closed diagnostic vocabulary includes terminal kinds such as `playback_interrupted` and
`original_rollback`; HLS direction `refresh`; delivery reason `original_open_rollback`; and
Original-check outcomes `started`, `succeeded`, `no_body`, `deadline`, `transport`,
`inconclusive`, `server_state` and `refused`.

The same independent choice also covers a handled sign-in error report when a sign-in attempt
fails, sent automatically the same way a crash report is. That report contains which stage failed
(`pin_create`, `authorization`, `discovery` or `other`), a coarse class of what the last attempt to
reach plex.tv actually did (an HTTP status range such as `answered_4xx`, or a transport class such
as `dns`, `tls`, `timeout` or `transport_other`), that exact HTTP status or curl return code as a
bare number, a bucketed count of consecutive unanswered attempts, a bucketed duration of how long
the attempt had been failing, which automatic code the flow was on, and how your sign-in is
protected on this television right now (`none` / `plaintext` / `secure` / `secure_locked` /
`secure_refused` / `secure_unavailable` / `unknown`). It contains no PIN, sign-in code, token, account, URL, hostname or
address, and carries the same Crash report ID as a crash report, and the same television model,
SoC, hardware revision, webOS release and the `rtkmem`/`install` sandbox facts a crash report
carries.

The same independent choice also covers a handled storage error report when this television's
attempt to seal or open your saved sign-in fails, or the file itself cannot be written at all. That
report contains which step failed
(`generate_key`, `begin_encrypt`, `finish_encrypt`, `begin_decrypt`, `finish_decrypt`,
`roundtrip_mismatch`, `envelope_unparseable`, `envelope_locked`, `no_reply`, `unreachable`,
`write_failed`, `keymanager_fallback` (a fresh sign-in was kept ACL-only after Keymanager3 failed),
`keymanager_fail_closed` (a routine encrypted update was refused or rolled back instead of
downgrading the existing sign-in),
`untrusted_mode` — this television found the saved sign-in file writable by
another app on the device, so rather than trust its contents it stopped using them and set the
file aside unread, under the same name with `.untrusted` on the end, which signing out or Delete
all local data attempts to remove and reports if cleanup is incomplete — or
`identity_unavailable` — the saved sign-in records which system-bus identity protected it, and
this launch could not register as that one, so nothing was decided about the key — your saved
sign-in is left as it is), the numeric error code the key
service replied with when one was reached, how the session is protected right now (`none` /
`plaintext` / `secure` / `secure_locked` / `secure_refused` / `secure_unavailable` / `unknown`), and whether this install has already
recorded that its key service is refused. When it is known, it also says whether the device key
this television's most recent attempt to protect your sign-in used already `existed` or was newly
`created` — the fact that tells apart a key service that is simply unavailable from one that made a
DIFFERENT key than the one an earlier attempt on this television used — and always says how
that attempt identified itself to the key service, as two Yes/No facts: whether it used an
application identity, and whether it instead used a fixed name on the system bus. Either is `Yes`
only where this television's system bus grants it, never both at once, and which of them (if
either) this app gets is what decides whether a key sealed on one launch is still this app's on
the next; a television that grants neither is `No` to both. Separately from those two facts about
this launch, the report also says which identity protected the saved sign-in
the report is actually about — `app_id`, `named`, `anonymous`, or `none` where the report is about
nothing protected at all — because the whole question is whether the two differ. It contains no key material, ciphertext, plaintext or
file path, and carries the same Crash report ID as a crash report, and the same television model,
SoC, hardware revision, webOS release and the `rtkmem`/`install` sandbox facts a crash report
carries. A `keymanager_fallback` or `keymanager_fail_closed` report additionally carries only
closed operation, stage, failure-category and error-code words plus the service's numeric error
code when present; closed `fallback_reason`, `fallback_phase` and `prior_protection_outcome` words;
whether DB8 commit/readback was verified; the numeric helper protocol; and whether the diagnostic
came from runtime or the developer-only synthetic test. It may
also carry the compact candidate-location summary described below: which of this
television's candidate sign-in locations were checked and how each went, using only closed words
and small numbers, never a path. It is sent only once you have
answered the crash-reports question Yes; a report found before that question is answered (which
can happen on the very first launch after an update) waits in memory, dated to when it actually
happened, for the rest of that one launch only — it is discarded, never sent, if you answer No or
if the app closes before you answer. The exception is a Keymanager fallback: its closed,
non-secret failure evidence remains in the ACL envelope, so a later launch can recreate the same
consent-gated report. It is still never sent after you answer No.

On shipping ARM builds, the private DB8 helper is authoritative for credential protection. Old
application-side probe and marker files are cleanup artifacts only: after DB8 is authoritative,
the app removes them without asking Keymanager to reopen their payload.

The same storage error report also covers `sign_in_not_persisted` — a fresh sign-in whose file
could not be kept the way this television decided to keep it. That report additionally says what
the save actually did (`persisted_plaintext`, `persisted_sealed`, `preserved_existing_secure`,
`blocked_unknown_envelope`, `write_failed` or `serialization_failed`), and, only when the save left
an existing file alone rather than overwriting it, why (`not_proven`, `refused_marker_no_fresh_sign_in`
or `seal_failed`). It carries the same candidate-location summary described above — a short line
built only from closed words and small numbers, such as `developer:open_failed:13,internal:missing,app_dir:plaintext`, and
**never a file path**. Each location is named only by which tier of the television it sits in
(`developer`, `internal`, `app_dir`, `runtime`, or `other`), and each outcome is one closed word:
`missing`, `open_failed`, `not_regular`, `wrong_owner`, `metadata_failed`, `too_large`,
`read_failed`, `untrusted_mode` or `unparsable` for a location this launch declined, or
`plaintext` / `secure` for one it read. `unparsable` means the file was there and readable and its
contents were not a shape this app recognises at all — a truncated or empty save; the contents
themselves are never sent, only that word.

Separately, **whether or not crash reporting is on**, you can send a **one-off report** from the
sign-in screen's Details panel, or accept the report offered after a sign-in problem. Opening
Details does not send anything: the report leaves only after you confirm "Send report". A manual
request is identified separately from an automatically detected sign-in failure; working QR
polling is not reported as a connection failure merely because you requested diagnostics.

The one-off report includes the sign-in stage and bounded connection facts described above,
the app version, webOS version and hardware-class information, and storage diagnostics when
available. These distinguish the original startup read from a later fresh sign-in save: candidate
location categories and rejection reasons; whether account/server credentials were present
(booleans, never the credentials); whether the stored session qualified for a local boot; key-service
stages and numeric errors, registration and sealed-key identity categories; save outcomes; exact
readback match/mismatch/rejection; and credential-file write attempts by candidate category,
operation, numeric OS error or policy rejection. A failed directory synchronization is recorded
as a durability warning, not disguised as a successful synchronization. No file contents, file
paths, account names, tokens, PINs, sign-in codes or network addresses are included.

It carries **no identifier that persists between reports or identifies you or this television** —
not the Crash report ID, not the Analytics ID. A random ID identifies this one event and may be
shown so you can quote it when reporting a problem. It does not enable either optional reporting
category or store an account-wide consent decision. Reports are tagged `standing` or `one_off`
so explicit requests cannot be confused with reports sent under the persistent setting.

Normally the report is queued on disk for background delivery. If the queue cannot be written,
the app can attempt one bounded background send directly from memory instead. "Queued" does not
mean received; a direct request is marked sent only after a successful server response. If the
direct attempt fails, you can retry explicitly. An in-memory request cannot survive closing the
app. Signing out or deleting local data clears pending local report state; neither that action
nor a later reporting-setting change can retract a report already transmitted.

## Optional product analytics

Product analytics is a separate choice and is off until you choose to share it. If enabled,
PlxNative sends typed screen and feature events and broad sign-in and playback outcome classes to
PostHog in Germany. Reports carry a random Analytics ID created when you turn product analytics on
and may include the app version, webOS version, television model and SoC, whether the selected
server is local, remote or relayed, and how the saved sign-in is stored on this television. Turning
product analytics off, or signing out, deletes the local identifier; enabling it later creates a new
one.

The Settings screen shows field-by-field example payloads produced through the same serializers
used for real reports.

Every product analytics event also carries this bounded compatibility and connection context:

## Never included in optional reports

Optional reports have no fields for media titles, Plex accounts or profile names, searches, server
names or addresses, access tokens, subtitle text, key material, ciphertext, plaintext, file paths,
or exact viewing history.

## Your choices

Crash reports and product analytics are independent. You can enable either, both or neither during
setup, and change either choice later in Settings → Privacy & data. Withdrawing a choice
immediately stops new reports of that category and deletes that category's identifier from this
television; removal of queued records is then performed on the bounded persistence worker. One
report that the sender had already picked up at the moment you withdraw a category may still be
sent; no further report of that category is picked up after it. Signing out, or Delete all local
data, immediately closes both reporting gates and clears pending in-memory reports, then orders the
durable cleared records and on-disk purge on that worker before a new sign-in is permitted. A disk
cleanup failure is shown separately; it can leave obsolete local material behind, but closed gates
do not permit that material to be sent.

When this notice changes, whether you are asked again depends on what changed. A wording-only
revision — clearer language describing the same data and the same purpose — is never a new
question. A new field that is derivable from a field already described here — a raster figure
beside a width and height you were already told about, say — is checked against the answer you
already gave rather than opening a new question. A wider purpose, or a new field with data
materially different from what you were told, is a new question for the change alone, asked
before PlxNative starts collecting it. That question is never both categories at once: it names
only the category that actually grew, and if you had the other one off, or never turned this one
on to begin with, it is left exactly as it was.

**Declining an expansion is not the same as switching a category off.** If you already have a
category on and a later update grows what it collects, you are asked only about the new part — and
saying no there keeps the category on exactly as you already agreed to it, sends nothing of the new
part, and does not ask again until it grows further still. Turning a category off entirely is a
separate action, done any time in Settings → Privacy & data, which is the paragraph above. The
record of what you accepted, and what you last declined, is kept, so a later expansion is always
checked against the real answer you gave — not against a guess, and not against an earlier no that
covered a smaller change.

To ask what a category holds for your installation, or to have it deleted, write to the contact
below and quote the identifier Settings shows for that category — the Crash report ID for crash
and error reports, the Analytics ID for product analytics. Each identifier is the only handle its
reports carry, so a request without it cannot be matched to that installation. For a one-off
report, quote the event-specific Report ID shown after sending. It can locate that individual
event, but there is no persistent account or television identifier linking your other one-off
reports together.
