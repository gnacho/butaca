# wake-tv.sh — wake the LG dev TV (49SM9000PLA) from standby via Wake-on-LAN and
# wait until SSH answers; or put it INTO standby for testing the cycle.
#
#   wake-tv.sh            wake + wait (fast no-op if already up).  Exit 0 = ssh up.
#   wake-tv.sh standby    ask webOS to power off to standby (clean, resumable by WoL).
#   wake-tv.sh status     one reachability probe, prints UP/DOWN.  Exit 0 = up.
#
# Config resolution (nothing about your network is baked into this file):
#   TV_HOST — $TV_HOST, else $TV, else the Makefile's TV default.
#   TV_MAC  — $TV_MAC, else the gitignored .tv-mac cache, else looked up from the ARP
#             table while the TV is reachable and cached there for next time.
#   TV_USER (root)  WAKE_TIMEOUT (180 s)
#
# Notes from live use (see SKILL.md Gotchas):
#  - The TV auto-drops to standby after a few idle minutes; every automation session
#    starts here. Wake typically takes 15-60 s, occasionally ~2-3 min — hence the
#    generous default timeout and the WoL resend every ~20 s while polling.
#  - macOS has no `wakeonlan` out of the box; python3 broadcasts the magic packet.
#  - SSH auth: the installed key is tried first; the Makefile's sshpass fallback covers
#    a machine without one. Key auth simply wins when both are available.
