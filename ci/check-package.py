    dev build is `features:+tel:98c4b7d3`, which equals neither of the two literals this was once

    that day the answer was None for EVERY build this project makes. Nothing failed — the callers
    print "SKIP — neither shipped configuration" and move on — so the dev-trigger gate, the
    dev-only-library gate and the reported-version gate all graded nothing on every CI run. Exactly
    the defect class DEV_WITNESS is commented against, a witness that cannot fail, reached by
    another route. The release cut carries `SYMBOLS=1`, which adds a THIRD field, so repairing the
    two literals by hand would have left the release job ungraded anyway.

# and until 2026-08-29 this was a plain `version in evidence` substring test over the text of
# `fwcompat.py` and `webos5-port.md`. **That test could not catch its own motivating defect**: both
# documents are full of dates, and `"26" in "2026-08-11"` is True. Widening the corpus made it
# worse rather than better — `docs/webos10-lab-report.md` quotes, in order to refute it, somebody
# else's gloss "= webOS 25 and 26", so the corpus contains the exact string being guarded against.
#
# So the evidence is ENUMERATED instead, and a named version is accepted only when it is a
# component-wise prefix of something in it: `webOS 10` passes on 10.2.0, `webOS 4.5` passes as LG's
# marketing number, `webOS 26` and `webOS 25` fail.
#
# This list is a transcription and transcriptions rot in this repo — so the failure message names

# and prints the releases it holds; when it grows one, that output is what corrects this line.

#
# `resources/<locale>/appinfo.json` gives the launcher tile and the store listing a title and
# description per television language. LG documents exactly two properties in one — "In the
# appinfo.json file for localization, you should fill appDescription and title properties. All
# other properties are kept the same as the top-level appinfo.json file" — and requires UTF-8
# WITHOUT BOM for non-Latin text. Both are gated below, and neither is cosmetic:
#
#   * a THIRD property in one of these files is `pkg/appinfo.json` duplicated. The version would
#     then live in a file `ci/bump-version.py`, `release.yml`'s tag guard and every version
#     assertion in THIS file have never heard of — the failure `ci/flavor.py`'s "PATCH, DO NOT
#     DUPLICATE" exists to prevent, arrived at from the other direction.
#   * a BOM makes the file unparseable to a strict JSON reader while looking identical in every
#     editor and in `git diff`. LG asks for its absence by name, so this is their rule, not ours.
#
# This runs against the TRACKED tree in every invocation, including the one that has no package
# staged — the tracked-only branch below is what `release.yml`'s `prepare` runs before a tag
# exists, and a translation is exactly the kind of thing that gets edited by hand.

#     and one allowed token vouches for the other. v0.2.1's libraries pass that test.
#   * tokenising to fix it, without keeping the leading boundary, makes plex.tv's own
#     `/api/v2/home/users` read as `/home/users` and fails every build.

# So: extract each path WITH its boundary character, drop the boundary, and allow per PATH.
